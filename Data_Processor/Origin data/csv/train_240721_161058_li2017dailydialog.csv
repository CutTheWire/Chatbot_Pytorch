7, We had a difference of opinion . 
4,Is sailing fun ? 
17, Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
17,I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . 
17," Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . "
39," Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . "
17," Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
32," Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . "
35,"Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? "
67," Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . "
14," Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? "
57," Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . "
21," Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . "
24," Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . "

16," Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . "
14," Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . "
14,"Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? "
11,"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? "
53," Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . "
17," Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? "
30," all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say "" cheese "" . OK , got you . That's terrific . "
22," Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . "
18," Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? "
40," Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . "
19, 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . 
48," I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . "

18," I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . "
35," Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . "
12, I see . I have run as fast as I can . 
48," That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any "
12, Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . 
20, Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . 
10, I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . 
17," Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . "
37," yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . "
21," Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? "
9," Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . "
23," Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . "
19,"You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . "
39, You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . 
28, A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . 
21, I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
17, I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . 
26, We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! 
21," In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . "
15," We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . "
15, I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
6,What day is it today ? 
17," I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . "
20," Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . "
28, There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . 
46," Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . "
33, That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . 
14, He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
22, That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . 
13,We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? 
53," What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . "
17,"The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! "
19," Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? "

14, Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . 
7,Why are you all dressed up ? 
27,"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . "
30," And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . "
15,"Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . "
21," Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! "
13," Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? "
5,My girlfriend dumped me . 
15," Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . "
12," It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . "
42," No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . "

7,I think he deserved his gold . 
17, It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected .

14," Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? "
8," Fine , thanks . How about you ? "
53,"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . "
22, I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . 
21," Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . "
16,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . "
27," I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . "
13,"Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . "
20," No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . "
33," Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . "
22, There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . 
14," Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . "
22," He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . "
13, Just type in the number on the back of your library card . 
27," Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . "
13,Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . 
14, Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
25," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . "
39," Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . "
17,"Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . "
10," Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . "
53," Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . "
40," I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . "
10,Thanks for helping me move into my new house . 
47," That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? "
29," Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? "
18," I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . "
46," Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , "
24," In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . "
15, Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . 
12, You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 
19, Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . 
13," Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time . "
18,Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . 
9, I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
28," Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . "
15," I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . "
12,The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . 
33," You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . "
84," Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . "
9,Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . 
10, Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
9,I'm going to see the doctor this weekend . 
14," Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . "
15," Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . "
27," But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . "
10,"I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . "
10, Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you . 
8,Why do you go fishing so often ? 
35," Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . "
25, We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ? 
27, Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
67," Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . "
34," I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . "
14, How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood . 
16," Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . "
16, I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
14," She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . "
28," Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . "
17,"Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . "
15, I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . 
11,"I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . "
20," Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . "
7, Who cares ? She is pretty . 
12, I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . 
27," It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . "
24, The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . 
17, That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . 
28," I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . "
43," Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . "
30, I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 
12, Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well . 
22," He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . "
19," You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . "
15, Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . 
13, No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . 
9, I also need to check this magazine out . 
6,Have you heard the news ? 
16,"Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . "
27," I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . "
29," Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now . "
14," Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . "
34, Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
21, But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . 
12, I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . 
35," Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . "
27, So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . 
19,Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . 
21," Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office . "
21," Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . "
24," Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain "
13, It may have something to do with the food I had last night 
68," It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . "
28," Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! "
34," You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . "
31," It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . "
19, I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ? 
17, I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ? 
14, I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . 
16," Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face . "
24," Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go . "
15," By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is . "
11, That ’ s a good way to think about it . 
46," Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? "
15, But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 
72," Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . "
21," That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? "
40," In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! "
13, Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . 
25," Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . "
59," I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . "
17," Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . "
14," My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . "
14, You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
31," Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . "
22, How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . 
24," I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . "
16, Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 
16," You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . "
21, Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ? 
19," You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now . "
36," Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . "
24," Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? "
38, Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
38," We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . "
10, Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor . 
18," It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . "
18,"Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ? "
37, Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . 
29," Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . "
19," Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . "
20," Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . "
11,"Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? "
19, Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? 
22,"Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . "
8," You are not English , are you ? "
34, I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
43," I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . "
29, I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . 
12," No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . "
23," Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... "
11, She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . 
26, Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . 
22," He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time . "
38," In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . "
16, I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
12," Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? "
19, Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . 
21," When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . "
15," It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? "
36, Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
31," Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . "
70," Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . "
12, You ’ re going to need to pay for the damage . 
63," Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . "
56," Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . "
12, Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . 
13," Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . "
50," Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . "
23, I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . 
17," That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . "
26," You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! "
29," It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . "
18,"Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . "
44," We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . "
43," Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . "
14," In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . "
46," Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . "
10," Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? "
11, I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
27," To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . "
102," Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . "
43," I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . "

24, Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
41," Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . "
36, I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
16," I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . "

The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . "
14," Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? "
97," Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! "
19, No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly . 
4,I'm terribly nervous . 
21," You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? "
18, I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
10, Your books are due back two weeks from today . 
17, I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . 
37," You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . "
36," Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . "
11," Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . "
17,Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . 
9, I don't know . I just woke up . 
51, In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . 
24," If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . "
16, Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . 
18," Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? "
57," Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . "
29, Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me .

5,Are you free tonight ? 
23," It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . "

21," Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . "
21," Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . "
21," Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . "
26, I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . 
24," Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? "
20, Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ? 
17, No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder .

18, Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? 
8,Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
49, I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . 
21," You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . "
16," In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . "

9, Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . 
14, Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
25," Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ? "
20, I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other . 
23, We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun . 
25," She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . "

25," Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . "
21," Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . "
16," I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . "
39," You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . "

16, I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
22," Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? "
97," Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . "
16, Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
20, No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
14, I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . 
17," Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . "
45," Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . "

40," Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . "
23, Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? 
11, I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . 
43," No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . "

21," No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . "

25, Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! 
63," Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . "
14," Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . "
45," Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . "

13, You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . 
6,Did you pass the test ? 
26, I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . 
19, I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . 
15, Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
32,I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me . 
18," Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . "

14," On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts . "
25," I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . "
13,"Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? "
17," It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . "
17, Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? 
12, Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! 
37," i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . "
16," I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . "
23, I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .

25," You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you , Stu . Are you sure you know how to use it ? "
16," Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? "
55," Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . "
12," Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . "
14, I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . 
11, My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . 
7,Where do you spend the weekend ? 
16, But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? 
23, Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it .

88," Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! "
19," It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . "
11, Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . 
7,The teacher just canceled the test . 
21," I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? "
26," Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . "
21, That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . 
49," Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . "
40," Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA . "
17," Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . "
58," We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? "
9,Don't be afraid . Give it a try .

29," Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too "
19, Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . 
48," The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . "
10, Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
23, No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ? 
16, Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond .

27," Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! "
68," Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . "
12,"Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . "
11,Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? 
65," Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... "
13, Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . 
21," You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . "
16, We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
14, Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 
23," It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . "
21," Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . "
7,How about doing shopping this weekend ? 
28," Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . "
8, Don't worry . Everything will be fine . 
18, I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . 
14, I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
41, I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
51," Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? "
19, Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . 
27, It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory . 
18," Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! "
45," Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . "
26," Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? "
24," The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . "
28," OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? "
40," Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . "
29," It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . "
22," Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . "
12, That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
32," I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . "
12, I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . 
18, I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . 
14, Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
29," Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . "
16," No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? "
16," Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . "
13, Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? 
10,I don ’ t know why I married him . 
40," Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . "
23," It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . "
16," Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . "
42," Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . "
16," Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . "
9,How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? 
38," Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . "
31," Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? "
23, Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
16,I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 
17," Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . "
29," I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . "
28, I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
17, I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . 
36," No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . "
19," That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? "
9, There are some seats in the rear mezzanine . 
29, Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . 
12," No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? "
41," Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! "
48," Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? "
22,I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . 
19," It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . "
11," Since we're late , let's go to see a film . "
7,My uncle passed away last night . 
25," That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . "
15," Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? "
3,How's business ? 
52," Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . "
45," Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? "
18, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
18," Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! "
56," I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . "
9,It's hard to get tickets for the movie . 
9, I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
19," Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . "
27, They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! 
21, Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . 
20, I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . 
26, You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
21, What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 
19," A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . "
12,I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . 
40," Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . "
13," Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? "
24, We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . 
20, She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . 
22," He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . "
15,You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . 
15," Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please . "
16, Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . 
19, Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . 
13," To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . "
31, So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . 
21," Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . "
32," no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . "
45," I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . "
45," I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . "
10," Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . "
21," I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . "
13," Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . "
40, I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
28," Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . "
62," I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . "
38," Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . "
28," no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . "
21,"Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . "
24," But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . Can you do that ? "
10,I wish I had access to the public library . 
4,Are you ready ? 
12," From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . "
13,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
7,Our team just scored a goal . 
16, Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 
22, She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 
28," I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . "
28," If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . "
15, Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . 
24," lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter . "
16,I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
27, Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . 
20," I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . "
18," Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead . "
21," I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . "
6,Why aren't you at work ? 
53," I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . "
22, One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
18, Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . 
27, You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... 
42," I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . "
12," OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . "
35," No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... "
10, Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? 
10," On the contrary , I think he's very serious . "
18,"Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? "
11, Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you . 
15, Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day . 
13,It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
29," After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . "
43," Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a "
22, I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . 
29," Well , I have been in a host home before . During my first year in the us , I stayed with a family . They are nice . "
55," Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? "
11," If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . "
13," Until you pay it , you can ’ t check out books . "
83," Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . "
58," Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . "
11, Do you think you can tell me where it is ? 
23," Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . "
41," Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! "
19," Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? "
17,You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . 
38," There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . "
10, Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
13," Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . "
24," Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . "
16, It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 
42," Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . "
13, And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
35," They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . "
37, That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . 
22," Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? "
65,"Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . "
32," Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . "
48," It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . "
30," Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . "
22, Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
17," You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . "
24," I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . "
34," Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . "
10, That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
22," Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . "
21, There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . 
13, Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . 
38," I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . "
13," I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? "
16," Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . "
40," I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i "
12,"Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? "
14," Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . "
39, It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
25," I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . "
10,I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
25, And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . 
15," Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . "
31," No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . "
9," May I see your library card , please ? "
39," In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . "
11,Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . 
20," No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . "
12, Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
18, You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . 
16, I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . 
38," Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . "
9, Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star . 
39, Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . 
25," Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . "
15," Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . "
38," Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . "
18," Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? "
9,Are you working or are you a student ? 
16,I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it . 
50," Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... "
14," I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . "
21," Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code . "
13, I have two classes on here that are at the same time . 
42," Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . "
36, yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
58," Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . "
20, It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . 
6,What are you guys doing ? 
28," It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? "
11, How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? 
52," I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . "
16," Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ? "
18," Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . "
12, Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
14,Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
12," No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . "
44," It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . "
36," Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . "
27, It ’ s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ’ t take your twenty minutes to get there . 
12," It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . "
9,Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? 
9, I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 
10, Can you give him a call on his mobile ? 
23," well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . "
13, You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ? 
26," ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . "
32," It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . "
50," Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . "
28," You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . "
25, Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . 
18," OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? "
10, I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
34," I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk . "
18, Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
32," I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . "
17," Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . "
29," Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . "
26,The May Day holiday is coming . Have you made any plan ? Are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling ? 
10, That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
20, What are we waiting for ? It's already 7 pm now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now . 
26," Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . "
45," Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! "
16," Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . "
20," It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 . "

25,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
76," No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . "
19, I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . 
19," She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! "

4,What's today's date ? 
50," No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . "

56, Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . 
24," Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . "
17," Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . "
10, Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... 
23, Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
57," Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading "

31," Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . "
73," Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . "

17," That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . "
19," Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . "
35," They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . "
13," Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . "
11," All right . ... What's the date today , please ? "
30, Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
37," Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? "
15," That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . "
24," Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . "

41," no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working "
69," I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . "
33, You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
34,"Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . "
15," Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? "
13, Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . 
36,"Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . "
45," They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? "
25," Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . "
31," It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! "
16, It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? 
29, I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . 
55, Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday .

20,"Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . "
12, Nice to see you too . It's been a long time . 
16,Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? 
18," Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . "
18," I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . "
22," Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . "

11," Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? "
59," That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . "
11,"Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . "
22," No , he doesn't ! ! ! He plays the trumpet . So , what kind of music do you like ? "
19,Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . 
31," For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? "

76," No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? "
25," Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . "
11, It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others .

26," I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . "
36," Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . "

105," Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . "
50," At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . "

71," Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . "
21, Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet . 
29, Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? 
17, There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? 
9,"Mum , can I finish my homework later ? "
14," Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well . "
11, Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
10," Of course , but I'll have to go now . "
12," I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . "
9," Yes , he is running for class president . "
17," My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . "
47," To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . "
18," Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . "
12,I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . 
21," Now , close your eyes . ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand . ) "
17," Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . "
7,I'm so glad to meet you . 
14,"You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? "
14, I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . 
29, Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? 
16," well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . "
18," Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . "
33," That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! "
36," It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . "
76," Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . "
42," I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? "
26, He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . 
13, I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . 
11,I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 
18, Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 
35," The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . "
17, So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
11," I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . "
26," Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . "
23," No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . "
12," Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? "
16," You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . "
51, I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
47," I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . "
13," Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . "
27," Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . "
32," We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . "
15, Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . 
12, He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . 
13, Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . 
18, The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
21," We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . "
29," I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . "
26," As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . "
25," I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . "
34," Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? "
48," I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . "
21," This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . "
18,Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? 
7,Sorry . I've got to run . 
35," No , there's no double six at the end of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight . "
65," Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . "
15, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
12," Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . "
30, That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
10," Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . "
14," Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . "
8, Are you really interested in doing something ? 
25," Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . "
22," I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . "
20, Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
9," 0h , that would be nice of you . "
20, So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 
34," ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . "
19, Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
23," He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . "
22, I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . 
19," I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . "
13, Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 
39, Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . 
82, That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
17, Not yet . You should stand still for another few minutes . Late-comers must be recorded . 
12,Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? 
30," That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . "
25, I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . 
9,How do you like my new sports car ? 
34," Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . "
40, I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . 
13,"I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? "
12," A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . "
31,My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
40," If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . "
23,Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . 
26," Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . "
10, What a bone head ! Be careful next time . 
53," I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . "
8,That guy's manner really turns me off . 
11, You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . 
20, No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . 
22," What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? "
8," You made a good choice , then ? "
67," I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . "
25," It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . "
21, How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . 
17, Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 
45," I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! "
17," Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . "
8, Can you believe I'm going to America ? 
14,My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . 
28, And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
17, But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . 
18," Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . "
12,It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . 
32," That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . "
14, There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? 
17," I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat "
16,"You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . "
17,Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . 
40," But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! "
15," Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? "
20," Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . "
42," Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . "
34," you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . "
34," I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . "
32," Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . "
28, I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . 
16," Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . "
22," I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . "
15," That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . "
23," Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? "
19," That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . "
19, Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
12," All right . By the way , do you often dance ? "
31," Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . "
8," Yes , let's get something to eat . "
37," What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . "
6,I'll be seeing you around . 
20," What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . "
23," Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . "
20,I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . 
15," Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . "
37," You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . "
17," No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner . "
18, Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 
27," That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . "
25, She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . 
31, I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . 
21," Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . "
30," I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . "
27," Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? "
14,"Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . "
10, That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
13, I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
29," Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . "
15, I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . 
9, You will need to pay for the damage . 
13," Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? "
25, Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . 
9, How long do you have to be there ? 
15," Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . "
36," Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . "
3,What's new ? 
19," You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please . "
13, Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . 
28," Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . "
16,"What would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ? "
38, I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
18," Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . "
16, I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . 
19, There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . 
38," Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . "
24,"What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? "
30,"How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . "
32," Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . "
48," Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . "
34," Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . "
17, I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
13, He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . 
34," That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . "
14, Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? 
79," We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . "
13," Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . "
28," You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . "
14, Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . 
19,"He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . "
10,"Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . "
39," Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! "
51," no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t "
13, Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . 
24," And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . "
9,Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
8,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
47," Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . "
8,You were right . It's raining again . 
13, Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
13," They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . "
43," I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . "
13, I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . 
11,Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . 
8, What are you going to do there ? 
17," OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . "
12," Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . "
25," Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again . "
61," That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . "
20,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? "
7,We have a class outing today . 
21," Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? "
12," No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time . "
38, I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
46," besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . "
16,"Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . "
9,Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? 
17," A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . "
8,"Would you like some coffee , Tom ? "
20,Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . 
13,What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? 
8, And we're going to have summer vacation . 
15, Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . 
12, I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . 
16,"When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . "
7,"This is my uncle , Charles . "
13," As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . "
31," Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . "
48," Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! "
11, I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
25," Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . "
44," How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . "
27, I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . 
39," Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . "
22," I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . "
45," I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . "
15, Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 
38," Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . "
16, Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . 
64,"Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . "
9,I go to the fitness center every weekend . 
21, I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . 
24," I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! "
16," To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . "
27," You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these "" big days "" , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . "
17, I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . 
16, Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
46, But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
18, Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . 
11," If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . "
60," Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . "
59," Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . "
24," If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . "
50,"London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . "
32," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . "
22," Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . "
51," Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . "
23, I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . 
41," Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... "
30, I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . 
28, He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
35, I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
11," Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? "
39,"Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . "
36," That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . "
13,It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
13, I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
23," Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . "
33," Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . "
22," Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . "
31," Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . "
21," No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . "
14," Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? "
21," Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . "
23," Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . "
31," Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . "
9,"Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . "
25," I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . "
14, A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . 
14," By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? "
48," That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . "
9," Because General , his dog , got sick . "
23," No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . "
22," In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . "
66," Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . "
16," Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . "
10,I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . 
11,You can keep these books for only half a month . 
35," Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . "
6, They managed a 99:80 victory . 
22, Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . 
13,What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . 
17," Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . "
35, It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . 
15," Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . "
32," That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . "
39," What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . "
25," actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . "
52," Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . "
11,Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? 
14, He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
10, Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . 
18," Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . "
29," Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . "
11, Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? 
38," Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . "
16,"Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . "
9, Really ? Maybe I should work for you . 
12, Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 
22,I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
73," From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! "
16," I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? "
21, First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . 
16," I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? "
44," Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . "
13," You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! "
21, I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? 
14," Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! "
18, I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . 
51," No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . "
20," I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . "
80," Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . "
22, It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . 
21," Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . "
8,"Another glass of beer , will you ? "
11, Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
30," Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . "
18,"It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? "
13," Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . "
18,I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
11,He was hauled up last week for the second time . 
16," I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . "
20," Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . "
29, In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? 
9, I think so too . It's just pointless . 
26," But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . "
11,"I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . "
13, About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? 
22," Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? "
37," Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . "
23, Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
33, Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy . 
22," Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . "
14,"Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! "
30," Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? "
14, I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . 
14," It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . "
22," Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up 25 present . "
25," Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! "
17, It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
7,Would you mind if I smoked ? 
17," Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . "
18," I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . "
12, Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? 
32," It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . "
16,"Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . "
39," Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . "
31," Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . "
15," It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . "
6, It was just a misunderstanding . 
11, That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
14, This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? 
32," Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . "
40," No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one "
14," Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . "
21, Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . 
19," Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . "
21," Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . "
16," Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . "
33, Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . 
11, I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
11, Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? 
27," Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . "
51," My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . "
30, What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
25," Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! "
13, He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
24, Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
17, Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 
27, Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
59," Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . "
23," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
23," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
21, It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . 
10," No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . "
13," Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . "
17," I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . "
44," Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . "
27," That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . "
7, Hi . My name is Dolma . 
8, I was born in Beijing in 1965 . 
71," Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . "
81," For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their "" accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . "
17,"Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . "
17," That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . "
14, I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
30, We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? 
19," No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . "
10," Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . "
33," Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! "
54," No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . "
15,The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
21," You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . "
42," Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k "
22, This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . 
16, No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
11, Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . 
15, But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 
47," According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What "
28," Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . "
15," Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . "
32," Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . "
30,"The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . "
31, Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home . 
13, They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . 
14," Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework . "
20," I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . "
16, Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
39," Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called "" Good Morning to you "" . But later someone added the words "" Happy Birthday "" to their tune . "
19," Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . "
15," Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . "
30," No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . "
13," I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ? "
15,"Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? "
23," Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” "
38, Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
15, We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
14," No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice . "
10, Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
13," I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . "
23," It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . "
22," Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . "
21," If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . "
21,I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? 
15, You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . 
8,How long have you been in China ? 
38, We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . 
25,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
37," Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . "
5,I just got fired . 
25," I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? "
13," Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . "
13, Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
21," That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . "
32," Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . "
17, Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! 
34," Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . "
18," I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . "
10," Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . "
13, I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
10,"Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? "
5,You hurt Ben's feelings . 
46," I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro "
19, I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
34," Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . "
26," Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . "
13," Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! "
19," It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . "
44, Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . 
29, The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . 
23," I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . "
15, Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . 
21, No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . 
22," Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . "
13," Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? "
28," Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! "
16,Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? 
52, I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . 
47," yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . "
41," I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . "
40," Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . "
20," It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . "
39," Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis "
80," Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . "
17," I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . "
18, I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
21,"Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? "
13, Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . 
25," I prefer the novels by Hemingway , such as The Old Man and the Sea . I like the simple words in his novels . "
10," If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . "
20, That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . 
21," Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ? "
38, I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
13, But you can see the key in his hand through the window ! 
48," Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . "
15," Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? "
9, It's the most fun I've had in years . 
13, He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
19," By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? "
8, Don't worry . I'll drive you back . 
23, But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . 
11, Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? 
19, Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . 
17,Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . 
28," Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . "
15, He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . 
39," Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? "
16," I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? "
40," Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . "
36," Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . "
29, I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
14," Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . "
20," No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less . "
18," Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . "
21," It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? "
33," No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? "
9,"Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? "
54, True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . 
31,What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
15, Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
30," Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . "
46," Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . "
15, Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . 
12,I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . 
25, Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? 
14,"Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . "
20, You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... 
36," I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . "
34," Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . "
9,I noticed your absence in class this morning . 
33," Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . "
10, But don't you think it's a little too cold ? 
20, I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . 
39," She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . "
55," Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . "
15," She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . "
14,"I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . "
18, B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . 
13, He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . 
31," yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . "
12, My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
35," I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . "
34," Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . "
23," That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . "
56," But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? "
23," Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . "
34," You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . "
11, Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . 
4,Thanks a million . 
33," I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . "
50," Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . "
56," I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . "
74," Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? "
48, I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . 
14, I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . 
30,"Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? "
32," Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . "
48," Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . "
12," Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . "
8, I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . 
13,"Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? "
29, I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . 
12, Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? 
21,Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . 
35," Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . "
22," Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . "
10, I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
73," Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . "
39," Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . "
11," Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . "
7,Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? 
18, He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous . 
13, I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
21," You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . "
9, I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . 
13," Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . "
12,I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
26, Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . 
46," Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . "
9," Fine , just don't do it at night . "
14, Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . 
39," I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . "
14," No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . "
24," Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! "
18, You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . 
10, She will be back soon.You can wait and see . 
11, I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . 
11,"I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah . "
13, I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . 
19, I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . 
34," Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . "
19," Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . "
26," On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . "
8, No wonder your English is so good . 
30, Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . 
40," Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . "
20," Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf . "
12, Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! 
14,"Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? "
17," Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . "
5,Why are you laughing ? 
28," It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . "
9," In that case , I'll be seeing you . "
26, That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
15," No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . "
33," Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . "
44,"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . "
17," Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . "
38, I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
13," As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . "
10,"It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? "
8, It was a kind of sixth sense . 
7, He'll never do well in mathematics . 
20," That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . "
22, Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . 
14," Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . "
34," I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . "
36," But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? "
14," Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . "
15,I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money . 
27," Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . "
13, I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? 
13, People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky . 
17, It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
8,Why don't you go out with Jack ? 
14, I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
34," That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . "
34," We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced . "
36,"Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . "
21," Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? "
33, They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! 
9,"It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? "
25," I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . "
22," Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return . "
42," You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . "
22,He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? 
20,"Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . "
40," Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . "
19," Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . "
41," Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . "
97," Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . "
19, Mr . : Here's a hall pass for it . Do you need someone to walk you there ? 
9,Can you give me a ride back home ? 
45," Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . "
71," Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . "
16," Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . "
13,"Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . "
19, Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . 
32, The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? 
35," Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . "
16," Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . "
19, Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
9,You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? 
18, The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . 
9," No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . "
22," Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . "
31,"Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . "
38," they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , "
12," No , not at all . His examples are really interesting . "
14,I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . 
20," Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon . "
13, I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . 
15,"Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? "
14,"Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? "
12,Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? 
24,"David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! "
20," I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . "
41," personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . "
29," You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . "
20," You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . "
12," Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . "
34," Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . "
39," I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . "
15, But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy . 
40," Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? "
17," Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
15, You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . 
20," You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? "
11, It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 
22,I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
17, I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
44," I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . "
24," Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . "
23," It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? "
21,"Hey , Cindy , I'm so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone . "
31," Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . "
12," Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . "
8,Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? 
38," Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . "
54," That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! "
50," I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . "
13, It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 
12,Sorry to interrupt . Can I have a word with you ? 
5,What are you doing ? 
12,Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? 
40,"Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . "
24," You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . "
22," I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . "
41," hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . "
27, The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . 
31," Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . "
14," Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time . "
17," Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . "
12," In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . "
28," Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! "
20," You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . "
19, Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . 
20," Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . "
11, Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
20, One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
42,"Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . "
42," That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . "
18,"I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . "
23, I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . 
36," Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition . "
22, I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
11," Me , too . I've heard so much about you . "
27," Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form . "
16, One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 . 
60, Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
21, Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
20, No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
23," You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! "
47," well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a "
20, It's very helpful.the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures . 
5,Look at the cloud . 
33, I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
12, Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . 
5,Where are you from ? 
22," It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . "
54,"Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . "
36," Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself . "
24, But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! 
11,"It's getting late , and I have to go now . "
31," you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . "
9," Why , this is the most interesting film ! "
20," Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! "
14, I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 
20," Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! "
33," Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . "
9," Well , shall we go to the cinema ? "
26," ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow . "
21, Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . 
44, I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . 
9,Hurry up . We're going to be late . 
38," But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! "
24, Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . 
9,What's the most popular sport in your country ? 
13," I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . "
10, It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . 
9, Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . 
73," I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . "
29, Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? 
16," I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . "
20," I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . "
28," Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . "
40, No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 
24, The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
14, You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . 
39," well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . "
11, Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
25," Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . "
42," He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish "
16," Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . "
16," Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? "
13, Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . 
10,"I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . "

67," That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . "

108," In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . "

13, I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package .

59," Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . "
26," Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? "
59," Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? "
18,"I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . "

18, He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . 
37, I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
24, I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? 
15,Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ?

21,"He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all . "

18," Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! "
15," Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . "
30," Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . "
15, That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card ? 
20," Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . "

15," Well , don't blame me ! I never get a chance to watch TV . "
6, Okay . Take your time . 
31, That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
15,He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
11,I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today . 
33," It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . "

37," Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . "
37," Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time . "
21," Yes , I ’ d love another glass . You ’ re a wonderful host . Thank you for everything . "
18," Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night . "
8," Morning , Lee . How are you ? "
18,I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . 
23," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
21," Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period . "
44, I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . 
16," Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . "
20," It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! "
32," we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . "

19, It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
106," I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . "
28," Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . "
10,"Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? "
4,Thanks for everything . 
17, I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
19," It's not that bad . If you talk to your American friends every day , you'll learn quickly . "
17," Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . "
54," To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . "
20, What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? 
54," That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! "
41," Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . "
22, We wake up early and go to church.Then we come back home and open our gifts together . How about you ? 
34," yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . "
17," No , I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi . "
23,"Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there ! "
25," Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . "
39," He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... "
26, I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . 
33, The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . 
7," Oh , no ! Not again . "
26," That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . "
36," I took more than 10 subjects including Theoretical Economics , Political Economics , Western Economics , Statistics and so on . In addition to the courses of my major , I took minor courses too . "
17," Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . "
21," If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . "
20," Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . "
21," Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time . "
18," Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? "
24," Boy , this sure doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ? "
17, Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception 
16, Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! 
28, Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
26," No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me . "
42," Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . "
34, I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
12," I'd like to , but I'm tied up with my paper . "
12," Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day . "
10, Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
48, You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
18, It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . 
10, I want you to have a walk with me . 
18," Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! "
9,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
27," Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! "
43," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
32," I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . "
55," Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? "
21," Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . "
25," You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . "
10," Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ? "
32," Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? "
14, My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
41," Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . "
23," Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . "
40," How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . "
11," Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . "
25," No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . "

11, I feel he is as cold as charity to me . 
34, I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information .

18, Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
51," Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . "

21," Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? "
51," Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . "

15, Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
11, Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world . 
15," That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master . "
15," No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . "
10, No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . 
18, I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
29," If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . "

38," It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . "
38," Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . "
15,Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ? 
16,I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on . 
21," Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . "
15, Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside ! 
40," There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? "

6,"Be quiet , Will you ? "
17," If you miss this class , you will have used up your quota for the semester . "
27," I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . "
15," What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! "
24,"Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . "
12, Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . 
27,"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . "
11, Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year .

27, Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
19," Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . "
24," Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . "
13, But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry 
15, And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
46," Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . "
14, That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
18, I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . 
24," I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things . "
13," Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . "
27," I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . "
34, I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . 
16, It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . 
12,"Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing . "
14,Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ?

10, Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
70," Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . "
33," Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . "
18," Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . "

38," That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? "
11, I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . 
22," Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . "

9, I'm just in the mood to act goofy . 
57," Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . "
41," my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . "
23, No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . 
16,"John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . "

7,The boss is mad at you . 
8,"Bob , what are you thinking about ? "
14,I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! 
35," that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . "

6, You can say that again . 
10, Just now we both thought it would be fine . 
11," Believe me , you really look much better than before . "

15," So that's four plates , four forks , four knives , and four spoons ? "
9,Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers 
37," He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . "
15, Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . 
18," No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it . "
45," If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? "
42," My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... "
53," According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? "
14, I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
66," Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . "
38," Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . "
11," Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . "
11," Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ? "
14, It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . 
21," Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . "
58," Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . "
23," Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . "
25," Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . "
15, So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . 
13, He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses .

26," Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . "
44," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
23,"How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? "
36," On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . "
10,I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . 
18," I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . "
18,"We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? "
35," Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . "
33," Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . "
36, Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
34," Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people . "
20, It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . 
22, No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . 
25," You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? "
63," Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . "
18, I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
12," He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . "
23, I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
46," They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . "
37," No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . "
42," So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . "
16, I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . 
13," Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . "
33, And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
7," Yes , she's a professional climber . "
12, So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . 
34," ok . It says , "" Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... "" "
28," I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . "
12, Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . 
15,Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . 
17," What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . "
42," Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . "
8, I feel like something good to eat . 
13, The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day ! 
21," You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . "
20,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . "
17," Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . "
29," Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . "
35,Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
15," Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . "
74," Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . "
12," Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . "
12," He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . "
17," Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . "

16," Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? "
11, Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? 
70," Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . "
26, He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
20," I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . "
16, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
14,"Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! "
18, I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
7,Which university did you graduate from ? 
15,"You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . "
27," But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! "
11,Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? 
16, That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
31,I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . 
45," Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . "
19, Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
17," That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? "
16,All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! 
26," Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? "
8,Shall we go to a movie tonight ? 
35," Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . "
33," That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . "
22, I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . 
19, Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday .

14, I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
9,Your father looks much younger in the picture . 
36," I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . "
34," It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . "
11, He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . 
37," When I told David I was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that I give your a ring . I was wondering if you could give me some advices . "

27," Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . "
56," It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . "
13, How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . 
21, What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
9,Would you like to have some more wine ? 
12,I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . 
13, She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . 
35," It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? "
42," That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . "
11, It sells almost everything you can see in the department . 
47," Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you "

24," I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . "

9,It's one of the highlights of the match .

6,What brings you to Beijing ? 
35," Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . "
11," I've been invited over to a friend's , and you ? "
20, I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . 
17," Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . "
15," I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . "
22, Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
10, I'm not sure how to find my next class .

9,I don't dare ask Jane for a date . 
8, My name is Jessica . What's yours ? 
21, You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . 
44," That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . "
45," Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . "
53," Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . "
16," Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . "

22," Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . "
9," Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . "
17," Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . "
9, I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 
11, Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you ? 
42," The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . "
14, How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . 
13," A minute , please . ... Yes , this way , please . "
33, And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
14, Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? 
19, There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . 
26," Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? "
19," It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . "
38,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . "

46," well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . "
34," I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . "
22," Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . "
14,"When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . "
23, It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . 
68," No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . "
17," OK , that will be twenty-five dollars . How would you like to pay for it ? "
15, I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . 
11,Would you like to go to a concert with me ? 
16," I will explain it in detail in the next class , could you preview it ? "

16, Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 
17, You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . 
20," Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
21," I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . "
11," Yes , please . That is very kind of you . "
24," Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? "
19, You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat . 
18,"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . "
34," Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon . "
42, that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . 
11,It is so quiet here . I like the place . 
14,Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ? 
13, I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . 
21," Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift . "
14, Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
23, My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
21, Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn ’ t cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
29," It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic . "
11,"We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? "
30, I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! 
12,Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ? 
25," No , I rarely smoke . I don't drink , either . I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends . "
40," Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . "
13," If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? "
12," Well , make up your mind . We need to know . "
14,"Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? "
47," To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . "
15,I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . 
21," Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . "
17, Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks . 
22, I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . 
17, Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
6,Do you have the time ? 
18," Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. "
22," My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . "
11, But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 
16, Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ? 
18," Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ? "
21," Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . "
40," Well , if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for , In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go . The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes . You might want to try there . "
6, No . Have a seat . 
22, I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . 
23," We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . "
44," Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . "
12, I want my hair to be only a few inches long . 
15, We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
20," Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon . "
52," I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . "
37," Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . "
22," He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . "
11, What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
52," It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . "
8," Yes , but it's not so appetizing . "
24," I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... "
31, It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ? 
16," Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . "
4,Mike's really angry . 
16," Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . "
22, Come on . I don't see any point in arguing about this . Everyone has a right to his own opinion . 
22," Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? "
11, Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
18,"I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! "
13, All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . 
25," It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . "
39," As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . "
28," I think it's too slow makes me sleepy . In fact , it's the worst in this week ’ s top ten , if you ask me . "
42," your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak "
25," Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . "
75," Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . "
38," Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! "
19," Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? "
33," Americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends . "
29, I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . 
19," My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner . My mother is a housewife . "
31," I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . "
32," All right . You can use the computer over there , enter ' tropical fish'under subject . If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title ' "
22," No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . "
45," it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . "
20," You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . "
43," well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don "
17," Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . "
11, It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . 
12,"Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? "
50," You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - "
34," Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . "
12,"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? "
15, I live in the southern part of this city . I rent a house . 
34," Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . "
21," Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . "
28," Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . "
55," I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . "
31," Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . "
36," why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . "
34," I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . "
8,Can I borrow some money from you ? 
20," In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . "
11,I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . 
42, Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
13, It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . 
10, I don't think so . There's too much competition . 
19," Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . "
10,How are you getting along with your wife now ? 
19," Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! "
37, Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . 
37," That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . "
26," I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . "
14," I don't believe ads.What ' s more , I'm already in perfect health . "
20,"In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . "
39," Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . "
16, I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
29, Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . 
13,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? "
12,Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . 
49," Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! "
28, She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
43," Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . "
36," It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . "
16," Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ? "
15," Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? "
15," I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . "
21," Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big.Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . "
15,Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ? 
46," No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin "
50," I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . "
40, Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 
72," Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . "
15, You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
12,It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... 
19, I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! 
7, And I score three of them . 
25," I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . "
25," Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . "
18, True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
29, That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . 
22, I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . 
16, That will solve it then . Let's work hard to not let it happen again . 
10,Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? 
51," Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? "
25," Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . "
15," Thanks a lot , Brad . I've got to go before the bell rings . "
12, Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 
22, What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . 
12, May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? 
10,"Mary , today is a great day for you . "
17," No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . "
14," Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley . "
36," Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . "
31,My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
36," Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . "
20," Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
26," Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . "
22," Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . I really have to go . "
12, I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music . 
18, Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . 
13," Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 . "
19, How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? 
9,Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? 
19, Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . 
9, She works as a teller in a bank . 
16," So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years ready for change ? "
13," I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . "
21," If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . "
11," Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . "
47, Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
29,Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . 
10,You are not being a good sport about this . 
47," You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . "
34," Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . "
8,"I'm sorry , but I can't go . "
9,I like the kid.He ' s so lovely . 
4, You're telling me . 
31, I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! 
41," Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . "
9,"Gino , do you really need to go ? "
14," Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . "
15,Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? 
32," that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . "
29, I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
16," It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . "
9," Me too , they're such a nice couple . "
19," We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . "
40, I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
16," Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on . "
5,We're going dancing tonight . 
45," Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it . "
18," Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . "
10,"When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . "
25," No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . "
20, So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . 
52," Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . "
24," Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . "
49," Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter "
31," it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . "
16," Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . "
25," ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . "
13," Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . "
64," I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company "
17, We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . 
26," It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . "
106," In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . "
29, How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
45," Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . "
15, Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . 
17," No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . "
13," Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? "
13,We have a live show of a football match this Friday night . 
30," Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . "
47," I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept "
11, So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? 
16," Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . "
15," If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . "
9, You ’ re a real friend in need . 
11," Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends "
14," If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . "
22," I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . "
24," This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! "
21," Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . "
20," I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . "
22," Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? "
31," it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . "
18,"Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . "
15," Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? "
19, I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 
15," Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? "
13, Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . 
24, You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . 
33," Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . "
34," I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . "
22," It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . "
17," Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . "
24," He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . "
8,I got a ninety-five on my test . 
30," Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . "
38," Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ? "
11, But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
12," Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! "
56," They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . "
26," Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . "
82," Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . "
20, Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . 
23, Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out . 
28, Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
21, I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time . 
76," That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . "
10, I was just thinking about you the other day . 
31," Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! "
72," Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . "
9," Yes , he is running for class president . "
71,"These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . "
34," Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? "
11, I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 
18," But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! "
33," Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . "
23, I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics 
14," I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . "
24," Sure . Take the tennis racket . Now , throw the ball up , and hit it with the racket . Like this . "
46," Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . "
21, It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
22,I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? 
20, Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 
21," Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . "
21," I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . "
9,I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
16, I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . 
12, I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . 
14, Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
53," I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . "
19," Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . "
7,Would you like some more rice ? 
12," Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it . "
50," All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! "
12," We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . "
18," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . "
14, I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . 
20," OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? "
14," Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? "
24," she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . "
24," This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! "
25," Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ... "
18,"I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now . "
18, It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' . 
55," That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . "
38," Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . "
33," Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people . "
19," I wish I could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home . "
13, Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . 
9, Most of them are from America and Europe . 
14," Surely , I do . It's hard to come by , isn't it ? "
29," It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . "
6," No , I missed it . "
19," Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . "
23," Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? "
18,Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! 
24," Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! "
17, So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? 
17," Honey , please . You're the only woman for me , forever . I swear it . "
35," Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? "
23,"Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? "
59," I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . "
21," we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . "
52," It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . "
15," Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . "
36, Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
23," This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . "
10, I think PCC is a lot better than here . 
12,My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . 
48," Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . "
14,"Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . "
14," Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . "
41," That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . "
23," We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . "
46," Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . "
13," OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? "
24, I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . 
33, Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? 
39," I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . "
11, Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks . 
24," Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time . "
16, Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
18,I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding . 
13,Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . 
16, That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
15," Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . "
25," I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . "
73," My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . "
11, The usual time . Half past two in the afternoon . 
32," I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . "
47," I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . "
19, I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . 
28," Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . "
63," Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study ? How do you do it ? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time ? "
14," Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . "
13, I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
14, Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
6,Why is little Billy crying ? 
34," sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . "
5,Rob lost his bike . 
17,"I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . "
33, That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
34," I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . "
57," There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . "
18, I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? 
15, I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? 
23, I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . 
18," I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . "
19, Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? 
17," That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? "
34," No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . "
9, I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . 
10," On the contrary , I think he's very serious . "
43," Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it . "
14, I don't know . My friend told me it was a touching movie . 
20," Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? "
23, Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . 
35," Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long . "
20, This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . 
10,Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ? 
22, Its very helpful . The course has let me into a world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
21," Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ? "
19, I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
23,"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! "
19, I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ? 
34," When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . "
17, Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? 
4, Couldn't be better . 
24," I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . "
76," No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . "
18," Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? "
18, Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . 
10, That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
15," I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . "
5,Tom's dating your sister . 
14, Can you stay for dinner ? We'd love to have you join us . 
18,I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
27," I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . "
36," It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . "
22," Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . "
62," Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . "
23, Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years 
27," Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . "
10, I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? 
6, Come on . Cheer up ! 
34," Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . "
12,"Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? "
46,I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . 
10, Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . 
8,The city has got a traffic problem . 
37," I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . "
8,What ? You want to leave early ? 
17," I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . "
12, It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 
12," Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . "
21, But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . 
9,I failed the exam because I didn't study . 
34," I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . "
25," I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . "
6,Look at that pretty girl . 
83," Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . "
46," You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . "
37," Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? "
46,your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta 
22, We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . 
12," One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . "
16,I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 
23," No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . "
10,Come in . It's nice to see you again . 
14, You have to pay it off before you can check out more books . 
10," No , I don't , but I like pizza . "
7,How was your date with Betty ? 
15,"The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? "
11," Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . "
16,I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . 
24,It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . 
38," Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something . "
11, What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
15," Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song . "
26," Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ? "
53," Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . "
12, That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . 
42,"The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . "
11, I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . 
13, You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
10," Yes , we met last year at a conference . "
11, No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow . 
16, Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
13, I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . 
15," Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . "
23,"It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . "
38," Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . "
14, He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
19," Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . "
17," Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ? "
50," Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . "
44," Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . "
33," It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . "
20," Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? "
9, I will need to take your passport picture . 
7, You are really a wet blanket . 
23," Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . "
18,"Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . "
99," Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . "
29," You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . "
17," Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful . "
38," Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! "
19, For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
11, Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
20, I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child 
39," Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . "
17,"Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? "
30, I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . 
20," Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . "
21," Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . "
20," Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . "
14," Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn . "
11, Because he stayed with me all the time that night . 
11, Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now . 
44," How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . "
40," most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . "
39, Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . 
26, The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . 
20, Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 
34," Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks . "
16," She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . "
19, Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 
24, You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light . 
18," Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . "
16, Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference . 
30, I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 ! 
31," Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! "
13, Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . 
20,He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? 
12, I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . 
14," By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? "
69," Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . "
45," Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . "
31," You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . "
16, We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? 
28," Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . "
43," Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . "
21," Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . "
49," Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! "
12, Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . 
30," let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . "
14, Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
39," I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . "
64," Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . "
11, Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . 
20," you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . "
16," No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! "
15, Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . 
34," You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . "

22, I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
28," The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... "

3,Get changed ! 
21," yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . "

17," Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position . "
22, It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
18, I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
14," Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . "
9, And I hear he gives very good lectures .

9, I think there's more you need to do . 
55," No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . "
41," not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo "

15," Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . "
8, There must be something wrong with her . 
38," That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . "
28," To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! "
80," That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . "
47," There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your "
6,This is my friend Jenny . 
23, You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh .

11, So you met her right after you got to school ? 
11, I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it .

16," Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? "
13, I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . 
53," I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . "
21," And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . "
38," There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . "
23," Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? "
20," Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? "
31," No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . "
15,He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . 
78," OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . "
29," You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library . "

16," Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . "
19, They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . 
14,"Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . "
31, I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
25," Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . "
24,"How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! "
19," Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! "
11, He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 
16," I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? "
17," That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? "
26," I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . "
15," I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . "
38," I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . "
11,I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . 
31," For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . "
7, It was a piece of cake . 
40," Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . "
41," Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! "
16, The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . 
74," Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . "
13, Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines . 
24, I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . 
12, I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 
57," Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . "
22," I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . "
7, We have a beautiful natural park . 
20, You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
23," It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? "
13, You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . 
20," Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre "
22, No . You have to buy your own . You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up . 
20, I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
29," Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . "
23, I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind . 
19,"I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . "
35," Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . "
58," Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . "
25," Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . "
14, You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . 
18,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run.It was nice talking to you , karren . "
38," Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . "
28, I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
21," For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . "
28," Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? "
57, Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 
9, The boss is planning to sell the company . 
22, Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . 
3,I've moved . 
11,We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . 
20, That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? 
19,"Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? "
14, I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . 
15," But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? "
16," No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . "
15, And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . 
11, It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
29," OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? "
35," I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . "
77," That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! "
17, Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . 
9," Yes , he once gave her seven roses . "
10, Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 
27, I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . 
28," Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? "
9,I like the kid . He's so lovely . 
19, I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
47," Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . "
27," Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . "
25," Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . "
42, You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
13,My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . 
37, We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . 
21," Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . "
25, I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . 
45," And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . "
40," Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . "
25," I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is "" Titanic . "" "
10, I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
10, Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? 
31," Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . "
13, It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
18," I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . "
16," He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . "
49, I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 
20," No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ? "
25,Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . 
27," I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! "
55," Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . "
37, Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
11," Actually , i could you some help.Thank you so much . "

20," It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . "
17," Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . "
23, It's very helpful . The course has let me into a new world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
16," They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course . "
38," Uh , to begin with , please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 . "
45," He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . "
16," No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . "
50," Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . "
48," She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was "" what's wrong with your voice ? "" "
27," Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . "
17, Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
33, It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . 
34," To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . "
11, It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 
19, Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . 
65," Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . "
46," Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . "
21,"Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . "
20,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . "
23, I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . 
21,All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
21, I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . 
25," Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret . "
17, After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . 
16, Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital . 
9, It's true . He is a hard worker . 
17," Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . "
20, Don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it . 
16, Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
29," Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweet , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . "
39, That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . 
10,I don't stand a chance of passing the exam . 
20," Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . "
17," Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . "
15," Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM . "
26, No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . 
15," Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . "
31, there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . 
15, Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . 
22, The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . 
14," He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? "
20," Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? "
41," I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . "
13, It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . 
31," I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . "
6,I just won the lottery . 
26," Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . "
20, Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
16,"Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . "
28," I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . "
37," Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . "
21,"I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . "
12,My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . 
11," Yes , you will have to pay to use it . "
20," Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat . "
16," I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? "
9, I really don't think this weather will last . 
18, I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
44," Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . "
40," I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . "
8,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
19,Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . 
29," We may go abroad , my wife wants to go to Egypt , and I'd like to go there too . We haven't made up our mind yet . "
33, You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
26, The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . 
18, I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
32," No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . "
15,Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . 
34," Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ? "
14,Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance . 
28, Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . 
22, Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned . 
32," Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . "
40," Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . "
15,Are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus ? 
17, Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
14, We all know that . Her husband always make a fuss of her . 
8," A little , but not very well . "
27,"Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . "
19," What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . "
14," Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? "
28," Well , Thanksgiving is family event.So on Thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner . Kids will have lot of fun . "
47," She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . "
10," Well , their team work is well worth learning . "
16," I can take a break at lunch time , but it is only 30 minutes . "
43," it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee "
22," You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . "
55," It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . "
14,I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . 
14, OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . 
17," Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot . "
17, I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . 
15," The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . "
10," Okay , I'll give you a ring next week . "
12, That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
47," No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . "
15," Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . "
23," Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . "
9,I hate to see the abuse of animals . 
11,"Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? "
12, Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time . 
18," How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . "
29," OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? "
21," Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . "
21," I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . "
26," I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends . "
16," Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . "
17," Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . "
14, Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 
30," That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . "
44, No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . 
11,Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? 
17, It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much . 
20,"People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so . "
37," Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? "
16, Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? 
20, Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . 
13," Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . "
21, Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . 
14," I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . "
5,Are you free tonight ? 
25, Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
33," Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? "
5,I quit my job . 
31," A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . "
17," Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . "
17, I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
14, My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
16, Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? 
32," I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . "
20," Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. "
11, You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? 
29, I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
43," Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a "
76," No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? "
5,How old are you ? 
28," To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . "
41," you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants "
53," You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . "
26,"Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? "
10,Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
62," Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . "
16, Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . 
13," I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . "
101," I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . "
16, That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
33," hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . "
4,A beautiful center ! 
22, Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills . 
16, I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . 
21,"OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? "
26,It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . 
38,"This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives . "
50," I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . "
15," Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . "
36, That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . 
11, Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
15," Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? "
6,What did you major in ? 
21, It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ? 
18,"Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? "
9," Yeah , I just bumped into the table . "
35," Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? "
50," After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? "
28," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . "
30, Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
13," Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . "
32, Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . 
16," Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . "
20," Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! "
44," Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? "
47," Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? "
15, I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
15," If you ’ d like , I can show you were to find it . "
30," The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . "
32," Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! "
9, Are you going to take your children along ? 
12,A new film is on . Have you ever seen it ? 
13," Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . "
9," Why , this is the most interesting film ! "
14, What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? 
23," Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? "
30," Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends . "
22, And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 
22," Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? "
12,"Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? "
14," You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like . "
31," Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . "
28," Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . "
31, I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
19," Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . "
44," Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . "
28," Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . "
24, Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? 
10,How many courses do you have for this semester ? 
42," I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . "
35," That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . "
28, I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . 
24, Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 
39," I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . "
14,Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
10,I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
11," Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . "
15," We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . "
43, That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . 
18, It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . 
17," Yes , Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back ? "
11, I learned to drive and I got a driving license . 
40," Well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I ’ m not as shy as I think . Anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! "
27, Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
10,Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? 
53," Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . "
9," Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills . "
29," Yeah . He ’ s been having an easy time since he was a boy , and now he doesn ’ t know how to face the music . "
41," No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . "
26," Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . "
17, So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
28," Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? "
22," To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe . "
22, You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” . 
14,"By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? "
13, You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
10," No problem , but you've got to be careful . "
28, There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . 
27, Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance . 
38," Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan – so beginning again "
19, I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule . 
29,Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . 
16,"Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me . "
17," But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? "
25," I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . "
17," Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . "
19,"I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is . "
30," Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace "
16, We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
23, We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
15,"I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . "
31, Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years . 
12, Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
16," All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ? "
23," I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . "
20, I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much . 
19," Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . "
13, A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date . 
51," Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . "
19, A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ? 
11,How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
12," I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ? "
11," Oh , I know . I will try my best . "
17, I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . 
51," Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . "
8,Do you have change for a hundred ? 
32," Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? "
24," On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool . "
17," Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . "
21," I'm so familiar with her songs , but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life . "
12," I don't know him , but I think my sister does . "
21," Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . "
7,Are you going abroad to study ? 
38, Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . 
27," I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . "
9,Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon . 
33," Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . "
12," I wasn't feeling too well , so I stayed at home . "
17," Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? "
19, Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . 
73," Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . "
36," Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! "
13, There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . 
28, Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 
14," Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . "
10," Yes , I can , but not very well . "
16, I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... 
29,"May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . "
35," The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . "
14, I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
16," I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . "
15," It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day . "
10, So you'll have a tour of the famous city . 
15, I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . 
18, I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . 
25, Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . 
44, I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... 
57," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . "
19," We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . "
13,It is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight . 
28," I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . "
19," Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . "
18," Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . "
49, I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . 
26," Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . "
18, I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? 
11,At what age do children start school in your country ? 
34," We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! "
50," But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . "
69," Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . "
14," No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . "
39," Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . "
3,Guess what ? 
23," Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . "
55," I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . "
22, Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . 
20," Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . "
19, Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
46," alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . "
7,That woman is a thorough drag ! 
14, He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
61," You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . "
17,"Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . "
20, That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? 
11, But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . 
32," Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . "
21, The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . 
27, Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . 
44," It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! "
21,"Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . "
40," He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . "
18,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? "
21," It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . "
18, Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? 
26, Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . 
31," Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? "
19, They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
46," Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . "
18, Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
9, The acting of the heroine is too artificial . 
18," Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . "
14," I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . "
14," It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . "
28," Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . "
10,I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . 
13, I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 
30," Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . "
18," Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! "
13, Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . 
9, Yes . She lives on the next block . 
18,"Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . "
7,I think he deserved his gold . 
41," Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . "
30," Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . "
18, I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
33," It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . "
24," So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . "
13, It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . 
18, Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
11," Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . "
23, But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . 
16," Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . "
12," My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . "
31," Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . "
22," You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes . "
29," Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back . "
42," No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . "
36," i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . "
55," I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . "
41," it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . "
15,Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? 
46," You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . "
21," Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . "
20," Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! "
26, he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
21," Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
14,"Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? "
26," Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . "
21," Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . "
10, I had to look after my son at home . 
10, That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting . 
21, that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
17,It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
20," It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . "
61," That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . "
26," absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . "
52," Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . "
13," Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? "
32," Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? "
13, There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . 
18," I like autumn , too . Where I'm from , Autumn is the best time of year . "
8,How would you like your hair cut ? 
42," She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . "
19,"I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . "
36," You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . "
5, The same as usual . 
19," Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . "
20," Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool ! "
33," I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . "
17, Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . 
15," Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . "
53," Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . "
18, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
23,Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? 
25," I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . "
37," No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? "
25, I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? 
23, Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . 
19," You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office . "
21," I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . "
16, Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . 
26," Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . "
9,Did you take my money from the table ? 
44," That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . "
14,Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . 
7," No , she ’ s average . "
15," I think Mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much . "
49," Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . "
15,The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
28, Please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ? 
24," I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . "
43," And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . "
35," Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . "
7, Let's stop and have a look . 
20, I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . 
40, That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . 
13, I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . 
9,I dare you to talk to that girl . 
12, Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 
14,Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ? 
15,The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . 
62," That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! "
14," Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . "
45," No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . "
14," Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? "
45," That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for "
7,Why do you like this computer ? 
10, I would also like to check out this video . 
33," Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? "
34," I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . "
32, It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
12,"I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . "
19, Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . 
12," Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . "
13, Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family .

36," it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . "
27," Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . "
10,How many days do you take off for Easter ? 
20," At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . "
17, Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
13,My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! 
26," I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . "
29," I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... "
23," Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . "
47, The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa 
15, You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . 
30, You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . 
33, Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 
11," Not at all , I was totally in the dark . "
18," Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . "
41," As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . But people still go swimming all year around . I prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning . "
12," Anyway , I dislike summer here.There ' s too much rainfall . "
36," I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . "
21, Anything you say or do might make it worse . Just try to ride out the storm for a while . 
24,"Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . "
19," She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her . "
21,"You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! "
67," I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . "
13, I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 
34," Will , I'm under a lot of pressure . My manager is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them . "
36, Not quite good . It's windy and dry . We have got continental climate there . It's dry all the year round . Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York . 
14, Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . 
11, Let me know if I can do anything for you . 
28," Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? "
35," Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . "
8,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
7," Where are you from , Sam ? "
16, I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
35," You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? "
15, I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 
49," Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . "
37," Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . "
17,"There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . "

9,What do you think of the new mayor ? 
17," Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation . "
16," Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? "
18," Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce . "
35," That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . "
35," In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . "
58," Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . "
38," But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? "
21," OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . "
21, Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . 
15," After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . "
17," Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . "
7,Did you have a good holiday ? 
20," My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . "
15," Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . "
23, I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . 
21," I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . "
16, I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . 
21," You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . "
20, I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 
18," Well , at least half a year . Do I have to do my own grocery shopping ? "
16, She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . 
13," I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . "
11,I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? 
16,"Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? "
8, That's what the weatherman said last night . 
29," I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . "
26, Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 
24," Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... "
7, I'm good . How are you ? 
14, Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
13," No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . "
11, That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . 
12,I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
22," Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . "
44," Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . "
16,"John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . "
25," Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . "
30," You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . "
21," Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . "
36," Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? "
15, Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . 
58," Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . "
21, Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . 
11,Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . 
11, That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
38," That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? "
67," Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . "
72," I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . "
7,"This is my uncle , Charles . "
10,"OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building . "
13," Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . "
17," Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? "
45," Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! "
22," I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . "
10,I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
14," You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . "
20," Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . "
20,"I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . "
31," You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . "
43," Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do "
15," I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . "
35," I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? "
60," Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . "
11," Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . "
30," I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . "
12,Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? 
9,Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? 
23," Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . "
15,"Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? "
22," Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . "
21,I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . 
30," I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . "
58," Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . "
48," What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . "
6,What does your father do ? 
39," Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . "
47," So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . "
14, As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . 
25," Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! "
12," NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . "
14, Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend . 
11, It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . 
29, So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . 
22," Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? "
58," Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . "
19," No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . "
12, Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
16," A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . "
21," Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . "
19," Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . "
38," Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . "
31," When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? "
35," Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . "

9," Would you tell us your name , please ? "
13," Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . "
22," Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . "
15, I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . 
12,All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . 
14, I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . 
10," Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . "
48," I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . "
8,"Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? "
31," No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . "
9," Not bad . How about you , John ? "
14," By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? "
18, But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . 
16," You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . "
48, You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
21," Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . "
79," Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . "
10, It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
16, I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine . 
12, Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? 
20,"Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? "
25," Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? "
42," You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . "
25," I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . "
7,What would you like to drink ? 
15," If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . "
11,Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . 
44," The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . "
15,Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? 
25," I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . "
33," Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . "
20," Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . "
18, Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . 
18," I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . "
34, I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .

14,"Yo baby , are you satisfied with the costume show in the street ? "
30," Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . "

19, Yes . Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper ? 
48," That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . "
20," If I let you go back to sleep , I know that you won't get up in five minutes . "
25," 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . "
13," Oh , how high class ! So you just wear it forever ? "

15," Staying with Ultraman , of course . You know he likes it very much . "
11, I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
19," That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . "
9,"I'm not sure , is this our stop ? "
33," Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m . By the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward . "
32," really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? "
26,"Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing . "

44," Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . "
13,The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident . 
18," I don ’ t know who placed the call . However , the call was from Toronto . "
11," Well , that's a miracle that no one was killed . "
27," I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success . "
10, What kind of car do you have in mind ? 
12,"Hello , do you know anywhere that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? "

38, I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 
23, Russian is my second foreign language and I excelled the rest of my class in Russian because my father is a Russian . 
32," No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . "
15,"Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? "
22," You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up . "
40," I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year "
18, Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . 
46," I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? "
76," According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . "
12,"Excuse me , could you lend me some of your records ? "
19, Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ? 
24, We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation .

14, I'd like a hamburger and a cup of coffee.My room number is 402 . 
19, sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
25," Well , I ’ Ve got a huge load of typing and Mr . Blake has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . "
29," Very much . The room is cozy and the service is jolly good . By the way , could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance ? "
95," You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . "
10," Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there . "
34," my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . "
28," But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? "
13, I ’ ll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe . 
8, Drop in if you're free.Bye for now ! 
10,"Excuse me , I don't feel good right now . "
67," The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . "
10," Wow , that's sheer robbery.Shall I make an offer ? "
21," OK . By the way , can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed ? "
7,Could you do me a favor ? 
16, The maid has just delivered some laundry to my room.But it's not mine at all . 
82," I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . "
16,"Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . "
17," First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . "
20," To cancel your reservation , I need your name , phone number , and date of trip , please . "
10,"Do you really like this straw hat , dear ? "
27," I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . "
16, I'll have a sandwich and small fries . Would you like to have some desserts ? 
25," yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . And this will help us understand both better . "
20," OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! "
21," Turn right at the third intersection , you'll see the street and then walk along the street to the south . "
46," I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? "
40," That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women . "
20, Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . 
16, Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . 
12, French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ? 
25," It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . "
23," The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers . "
14, Quite good . It was the most wonderful dinner I have ever had . 
40," OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . "
9,"Excuse me , could I ask a favour ? "
15," Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . "
13," Certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ? "
46," Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . "
34," Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . "
69," Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . "
58," Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ? "
55," Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . "
30,Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? 
20," Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? "
31," I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English "
42," Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . "
32," I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . "
21, I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction . 
52," Yes , then enter the bathroom , There is a stove tired with wood in the room , and on the top of the stove , there is a pile of stones , which keep the heat . Throw some water on the stones , and dry steam is given off . "
14," Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? "
32, I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . 
12, The four of us will be there at 7:00 this evening . 
21," I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . "
18,Hello . I have left my key in my room . But I can't get in now . 
45," Please to meet you Mrs Chen . My name is Joy . Welcome to the hotel . Here is the keys , registration slips and breakfast description . Breakfast will be served from seven tomorrow morning . Is there any change of your schedule ? "
21,Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it . 
20, Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . 
11," A lot , like the party I'm having on Friday . "
16," Of course , sir . We will press all the clothes when they are cleaned . "
29," No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . "
9," Yes , it's straight ahead around the corner . "
15," No , you mustn't sit on the grass.Don ' t you see the notes ? "
26, I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . 
10," Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? "
63," I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . "
14, Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . 
25," Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ? "
24," Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . "
17," Yes , the shoes on that shelf are on sale now . They are much cheaper . "
16," Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy . "
15, Then you can buy this one . It's very nice and latest in style . 
26, Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . 
17," Yes , thanks . By the way , what time do I have to start check-in ? "
12," Just an ordinary one , six people living in a room . "
32," No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? "
21," I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also . "
59," It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . "
37, I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
17,I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries . 
23," Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles . While I am waiting , I will eat my bacon and eggs . "
42," Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here . "
14," Here you are . By the way , when does the train leave ? "
23, We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me . 
28, Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? 
19," Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours . "
41," Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... "
53," That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? "
16, Here you are . Can I have a seat in the back of the plane ? 
20," Yes , I'd like to see the receipt . Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . "
42," I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . "
33," Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . "
30, It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . 
17, Let me see . I am sorry . ZW203 is the only one to New York . 
17, I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan . 
15, Try this one . You can get a picture by simply pressing the shutter . 
40,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . "
22," Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ? "
25, Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ? 
16,Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
16," Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . "
17, I have booked a table for 3 this evening . I would like to cancel it . 
14,"If I wanted to rent a van , how much would it cost ? "
11, Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service . 
14," I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . "
29," I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . "
10, One to the beach . How much is it ? 
33," Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? "
8," If I were you , I'd buy . "
39, Hi . This is Taylor Wright calling . I ’ Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9.00 tomorrow morning . I ’ Ve got to cancel this appointment . My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night . 
21, This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . 
17, You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep . 
15, We offer a 401K with some matching funds available depending on length of service . 
15, And I suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office doesn't help . 
35, I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ? 
88," Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . "
27, there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? 
28," Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? "
35," We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . "
16, I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . 
36, Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
7," I'm sorry , that's bad luck . "
55," You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . "
13," Yes , could you cash these travaler's check for me , please ? "
21," Hold on , please . ... I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . "
11," Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris . "
19,Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . 
40," Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . "
27, Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day . I want to change my flight for the 21st.Is that all right ? 
45," Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? "
36," I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? "
27," I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . "
56," Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . "
11," Fine , what time do you want to get up ? "
23," Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty . "
36, you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil 
27," I'm afraid we cannot help you , sir , because that would be violating the regulations . I owe an apology for doing nothing about it . "
11, How long does it take to get to the hotel ? 
15,Excuse me . We ordered too much . May we take the food home ? 
278," I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . "
18," I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . "
27, It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . 
33, I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs . 
22," Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ? "
7,Why did you stay home today ? 
20,Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack . 
17, It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 
13, Three . Would you please help us take them to the hall ? 
58," Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? "
38," I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . "
13, We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday . Ok ? 
21, Your results are posted on the website . Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers . 
36, No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . 
10, I think I'm going to get a soda today . 
16," I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope . "
47," Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ? "
52," Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? "
15, I didn't know you have student tickets so I left them in my bag . 
21," I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here . "
16," That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . "
25," It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think . "
10, Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . 
15," I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . "
19," Oh , yes . Arm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? "
11, I don ’ t want to see you back here . 
73," As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . "
18," Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! "
37," All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent . "
14," If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it . "
31," I think America really deserves the name of "" fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . "

55," Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . "

24, I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . 
61," Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . "

17, It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 
38," OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . "

53," Just a moment , please . Let me check for you . ( A moment later ) Thank you for waiting . I am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day.The next available flight leaves at 4:00 pm on 20th . Shall I reserve you a seat on it ? "

27," Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? "
32," Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ? "
18," I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . "
20, Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room ? 
22, It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? 
36," that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? "
21," I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . "
39, We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . 
9, I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . 
56," It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . "
20," For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd . "
21," Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! "
40," that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead "
7,I want to take a photograph . 
14, Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . 
57," This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . "
27," Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05 , and now it's 16:15 . I guess we have plenty of time . "
12,I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . 
23, It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . 
33," I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . "
25," Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . "
32," Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . "
26," Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . "

Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . "
28," By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . "

13, I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . 
29," All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . "
30," Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . "
64," You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . "
61," That ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done . "
22, They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ?

31," Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? "
13,"Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? "
50," Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? "
14," Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "

9, The paper editorials always stick to the quick . 
26," OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . "
26," It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . "
22," No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you . "
17, Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . 
26," OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ? "
74," OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . "
13,"Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? "
18," Hi , Ryan , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today . "
13, Then take the next left then the next right.Are you with me ?

14," My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September . "
46," No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? "
29," Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet . "
38,"Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat . "
9,Is there anything I can do for you ? 
25," With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . "
23, I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... 
23, I ’ Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance . 
39," It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ? "
55," Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! "
32," Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? "
12," Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . "
20, The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
14, I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it . 
24," Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . "
26," I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy . "
19, That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . 
20," Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . "
27, Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ? 
23," Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're a present for a friend . "
48," About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . "
42," For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . "
20," Not very big . There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . "
17," It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . "
26," Well , it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway . I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour . "
21, Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal . 
12,Do you have any idea why I pulled you over today ? 
48," Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu "
40," no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . "
12, You are suspected of smuggling . Do you understand your rights ? 
33," I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . "
13," Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one . "
18,"Why not go to the supermarket today , the coupon will be past due in three days . "
33, We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . 
12, I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
10,"Mommy , can I stay up until eleven o'clock ? "
24," I am just looking , thank you ... Excuse me . Can you tell me where I can buy a pair of shoes ? "
17, That is good . We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy . 
79," Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . "
20, You need to get a car tag first . There's a one hundred Yuan deposit for the car tag . 
46," Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . "
35," Yes . Moreover , since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day . I'm not sure we can make it . By the way , are you pressed for the time ? "
38," I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . "
16," And they have tangy , freshly-made salsa , too . My mouth is watering already ! "
32," Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? "
11,"Excuse me , but could you give me some change ? "
19," Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . "
11, What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ? 
8, I thought he only liked to listen ! 
35," Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . "
18," Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . "
40," We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? "
35,"I heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ? "
11, Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
21,Could you have a taxi pick me up and take me to the airport before 1 p . m . ? 
24," Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please . "
65,"Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? "
17, You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer . 
19," Let me try it on , it's too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? "
46," Well , we have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market . Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you . "
43, You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 
12," For 3 days $ 300 , for 7 days $ 600 . "
33," That'll be $ 4.25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . "
37," No , once I fill the tub with beer , I ’ ll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . "
17, I'm going to the movie theater with my friend . What are you going to do ? 
24," I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . "
9," Yes , I'm here to fix your pipes . "
21, Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches ! 
37," The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm . So you don't need a reservation . Seats are available on a ' first come , first served ' basis . "
23,"Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do . "
10, I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . 
21, Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment . 
21," My apologies , sir . We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund . "
70," Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . "
8,That man's really a bore to me . 
36," Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . "
31," well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient . "
26," I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . "
32," Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . "
14," Well , do you want burgers , Chinese food , or Mexican food ? "
19,"Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . "
28," Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . "

There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? "
12," Yes , here you are . These tablets are very effective . "
15, It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . 
16," Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ? "
15," Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . "
16, I recommend you this route . We call it golden routes for the sightseeing spots . 
27," A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . "
12, I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little . 
51, Yes . I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday . But I ’ m sorry to say that I have to cancel it . My wife is very sick now . I don ’ t think she ’ ll be able to travel by this Friday . 
31," You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . "
29, I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ?

18,Good morning . I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country ? 
16, We have got a 2 weeks ' vocation and we plan to leave on Thursday . 
12, There is a charge on my card that I didn't make . 
66," Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . "
14, I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards . 
14, Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ? 
16," Yes , I have booked a table for four . My name is Liu Fan . "
29," I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? "

11,"Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ? "
51," Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . "
14," Just a moment , please . Yes , you can have a seat . "
44," Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? "
13,"May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? "
20," Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . "
8,Where can I get a good novel ?

12, I know it does . I catch this bus a lot . 
18," I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit . "
58," En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . "
14, No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... 
27," Of course , I have . There is one in my old house . And I have another one from college at my parents ' house . "

33, It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . 
37, This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt .

22," I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . "
15," Well , I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change . "
13,I'm checking out tomorrow . What time must I vacate the room ? 
16," Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . "

13,Excuse me . What's the time difference between Beijing and San Francisco ? 
75," I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids . "

42," I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well . "

20," Thank you . I ’ ll put the call through for you . Hold on the line , please . "
51,Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . 
77," Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently .

21, I was the only person in my family reading it . Everyone in my family just likes to read Fashion . 
48," I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . "
10, That ’ s it for today . Thank you . 
10,I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ?

32," As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . "
92,"I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . "
20, But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby . 
62," I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . "
41, We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su

65," Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns .

25,"Excuse me , sir ? I just need a little bit more information . Could you tell me your telephone number and mailing address ? "

18," There are passes for a day , month , and week , and there are student passes . "

Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . "

16, Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . 
33," OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . "
36," I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now . But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? I can find a table by the window for you . "

13, It ’ s quiet and clean . I love the color scheme . 
136," Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . "
9, Get in . I will take you there . 
43, We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ?

68," I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . "
12," Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? "
15," To sum it all up , you really just don't know how to drive . "
11," Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it . "
34, I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !

44," I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better . "

99," First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . "
31," But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . "

17," Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are . "
16," I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please . "
12, Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ? 
23," We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones , too . Do you have a specific model in mind ? "

26," Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . "
49," Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . "

41," That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . "
10," Well , what game do you want to play ? "
34," OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? "
38," It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . "
8," Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ? "
12," Of course , what evening will you be joining us on ? "

20, Yes . Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th ? I want one leaving in the afternoon .

42," Tomorrow afternoon , Um ... you see , I've made an appointment with Mr . Comet for tomorrow afternoon . In order to meet Mr . Zhang , I have to cancel the appointment with Mr . Comet , I'm afraid . "
12," Sorry , madam . We don't have vacancies at the moment . "
11," Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ? "

14," How about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ? "
45," Yes . After my graduation from university , I worked as a Customer Service Coordinator in a foreign representative office , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a Market Development Manager . So I am familiar with the market in China . "

14," Yes , I have two cartons of cigarettes , one bottle of whisky . "
23," Well , could you bring me all the styles of pullovers ? I am not quite sure which one I will buy . "
36, I don ’ t think they are right . I have tried my best and that's enough . It is unfair that they are always saying these thing . Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt . 
14, Here you are . Can you put the bread in a separate bag ? 
35," Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . "

33," Hum , what you say make sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . "
75," Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . "
15, Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . 
14," Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . "

30," I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . "
74," It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! "

For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues .

21," No , I learned by myself . I have a good cook book that I read when I have time . "
28," I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . "
25, Not yet . I seem to move my house to that place . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this trip . 
31," Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ? "

19," I want to go fishing today , but I have left my rod and fishing line at home . "
15," Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . "

That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . "
8," Yeah , are you going to come ? "
31," As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect . "
35," Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . "
22, Yeah but the bus takes a long time . You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days . 
38," OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . "

10,What time does the next train to London leave ? 
65," Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label .

16," Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup . "

16,"Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? "
39," I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better . "

26,"I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . "
13, Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? 
29," I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? "

84," I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful .

13, It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . 
128," It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . "

32, The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . 
21, Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
24, We ’ ll give you your money back as long as the stereo is returned in the original packaging and with a receipt . 
12,"Hurry up , guys ! The train is about to leave . "

10, How long will it take to get to Shanghai .

14, It was at the beginning . You just need to keep it up . 
20, We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .

18, Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . 
18," Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . "

23," Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? "
47, But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! 
46," Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? "
16," Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . "
19," Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet . "
46," First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered . "
10,"What's it made of , could you tell me ? "
39," There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . "
18," Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . "
12,That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . 
21,"Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . "
31,"Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . "
16," Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . "

13," Here is the two dollars , will you bring me the receipt ? "
55," good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other Sy "
13,Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ? 
16, Never . But I have been looking forward to it for quite a long time . 
21," One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . "
45," Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . "
37, The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . 
17," No , I'm sorry . That's all I have . Unless you take a credit card . "
22," OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines . "
14, Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
12,"You heard who won the election , didn ’ t you ? "
16," If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . "
28, My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . 
24," If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . "
12, Yes . How long would you like us to keep it ? 
27," That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself ! "
41," Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ’ re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight . "
44," Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . "
23,"Hello , Steven . We're thinking of appointing an agent for our products . I want you to find one for us . "
31," Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . "
22," Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . "
16, Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
58," I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . "
19, It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . 
6, For here or to go ? 
8,"Could I have your name , please ? "
18," I realize that , and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes . "
36," Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . "
39," Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . "
20," OK . Relax . This car is an automatic , so you don't have to worry about a clutch . "
12," Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . "
24,"Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters . "
29," Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . "
42,I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position . One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job ? I know the company you worked for is a good company . 
18,"Well , this is not quite the style I want . Have you any suit in fashion ? "
15," Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . "
19, Take the same number bus going in the other direction . There's a stop right across the street . 
13," I am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund . "
15," Yes , could you tell me if there is a laundry in this hotel ? "
10, I see . Can I pay by credit card ? 
38," I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . "
44, I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
16," I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . "
19, We'd like to look around the town . Can you tell me the best sightseeing route to take ? 
63, That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . 
13," Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . "
19, Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number .

40," Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . "
31,"Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . "
34," first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . "
24, Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ? 
17," I think I have the cash . Let me check . Yes , here you are . "
31," You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . "
24," Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? "
20,"We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . "
25," Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . "
24," It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . "
62," Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . "
42," For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g "
40," You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? "
10, OK . Have you filled in the Declaration Form ? 
25, Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . 
16, I don't get it . I'll go and have our doorman talk to you then . 
19, A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts . 
7," Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco . "
18," No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things . "
9,I am a reporter from Channel 5 News . 
28," Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday . "
20," If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . "
25," By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars . "
18," All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please . "
25," That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . "
9,It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed . 
14, This is Room 705 . The air conditioner in my room doesn't work . 
53," You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? "
17," In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? "
11, Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you . 
21, Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your house keepers to clean up our room . 
22," most people eat tempura with chopsticks , but you can use a fork if you don't know how to use chopsticks . "
12," Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things . "
21, Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
16," Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? "
67," I'm not a very good sailor , either . My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . In fact , she never takes a voyage unless she has to . I am better than that , and even on the Pacific . after ten days of it , I can still find my sea legs . Well , happily we shall have a smooth passage today . "
14," No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . "
37," I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . "
34," OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ? "
20, Sure . Now it's all right . Here is your boarding pass and label . Have a nice trip . 
76," It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . "
32," Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . ) "
24," Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? "
20,"We're supposed to check in at the air-china ’ s counter . Thirty minutes before take off , Joe . "
16, I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach . 
36," The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later . "
74," I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . "
40, It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . 
27," I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . "
27," In that case , please get your passport and boarding card ready . Just wait in the terminal for twenty more minutes.You will hear the announcement . "
14, Excuse me . Sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? 
14, Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour . 
19, I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . 
34, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
56," Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . "
15, But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . 
43," That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . "
14," I'd really like to help you out , but I am broke myself . "
28," Would you please fill in a deposit form first ? Please write down your name , your account number and the amount you want to put in . "
20," It is worth 100 yuan and your bill comes to 230 yuan . The difference is 130 , please . "
5,"Sorry , I'm late . "
41," No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . "
18," Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ? "
15, It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? 
22, Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ? 
9, Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . 
36," He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! "
15," No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? "
31," If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . "
28," I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . "
42," As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . "
32," Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . "
18," When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments . "
22," I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? "
17,Sorry to trouble you . Can you tell me how to get to the City Bank ? 
26," Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . "
14," We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... "
16," Oh , really ? Thanks , I ’ m going to do that right now . "

7,The washing machine isn't working again . 
20, Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university . 
33," Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . "
28," Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . "
40," Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . "
15, The boat time-table is effective from the first of August till the first of November 
18," I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . "
11, OK . I'll see if I can get waited on . 
47," yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th "
12," According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th . "
11," We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre . "
12," All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? "
47," I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . "
7,"Oh , here comes a bus ! "
13, I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
46, All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co 
14," No , I'd like to book a single room with one double bed . "
26, I don't know what time it is.It must be about 6 o'clock . I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
22," Well , turn left at the first corner after the crossroad . It's near the corner . You can't miss it . "
16,"Hello , stewardess . Could you bring me a blanket ? I feel so cold . "
13, Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room . 
28," As the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , you know ? "
36," That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? "
18,"Ladies and Gentlemen , this is the Statue of Liberty . It's one of the American symbol . "
15, The flight number is Cz353 . it departs at 17:10 and arrives at 45 . 
32," Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . "
18, I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . 
43," We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . "
7, Yeah . I'm going with Jennie . 
12, I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
9, I'm thinking about that idea we talked about . 
22," Certainly . If you want to make a local call , dial 10 first and then call the number you want . "
31," Here's your schedule . After this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . And you'll be having dinner with our director . "
20," I see.You ' re a stranger here.Walk two blocks ahead , then turn left . You can't miss it . "
10, Can you tell me where the taxi stand is ? 
80,"Excuse me , can you help me ? I would like to change rooms if possible , I couldn ’ t sleep at all last night , because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise , also if at all possible , I ’ d like a room that doesn ’ t overlook the street , between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside , I didn ’ t sleep a wink . "
42," Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . "

15, You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ? 
61," Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend . "
19," Because there is a coupon for almost every product , we always bring coupons on our shopping trips . "
39," You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ? "
59," I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . "
22," Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . "
25," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . "
34,"If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . "
28," OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay . "
119," Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . "
39," Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . "

21," No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . "
34," Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token . Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . "
50," If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . "
24," Yes , you can take small sum of money and important items such as passport and keys and business documents and so on . "
8, Can you help me move this table ? 
14," He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? "
25," OK . Could you put your hand baggage on the counter , please ? Do you have any gifts , or food in here ? "
47," Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! "
13, Certainly . The service cart will be down the aisle again soon . 
25," Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . "
29, Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . 
35," Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! "
13, Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . 
42,I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . 
16,"Good evening , sir . I think we have reservations . Have you fixed them ? "
17, Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside . 
13, I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . 
25, That piece fits on to your ear . It hooks right on . And you just put the other one in your other ear . 
9," No , I'm used to having tea first . "
32," Oh , really ? Just a moment ... You paid with a ten-dollar note and I gave you ... Oh , sorry , here's a five left . I'm terribly sorry . "
20," I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy , because my passport was in the stolen bag ! "
47," I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . "
8," Could we have the bill , please ? "
24," I have a master's degree and I meet all the needs you want , so I am confident of doing this job well . "
21,"Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ’ t anybody home . "
29," Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return . "
13, I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
18, The counter is at the end of the aisle . They are kept in the ice chest . 
26," Of course , Ms . Walker . Could I have your account number , please ? And , when do these documents need to arrive ? "
18," I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? "
24," Actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along . "
32," This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? "
31," Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good . "
38," Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . "
25," Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... "
13, All I can tell you is our next President got my vote . 
30, You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
57," We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . "
19," Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place . "
30," No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . "
21," Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one . "
62," I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? "
22," In that case , please put my name in your waiting list . We know you are quite a good restaurant . "
8,Mr . Smith just called me back . 
19," Yes , I often feel like a million dollars after work , like I can take on anything . "
11," Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? "
23," No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now . "
48," First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . "
8,Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 
39," Yes , my name is Peter . I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st . I'd like to make some changes . The reservation should only be to June 20th . "
12," Ok , sue , I will just go in get her . "
24,"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . "
28, It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? 
18," Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim . "
33," Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application . "
18, Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
6, It's good to be home . 
32," It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years . While it is difficult , I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession . "
36," I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . "
25, I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper . 
34," That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? "
27, Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company . Our general manager invites you to a dinner party . Do you think you can manage it ? 
13,"John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ? "
43," yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . "
35," The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents . "
9,I feel dizzy and I have a headache . 
23, ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . 
39," OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . "
12, It is unnecessary . I'll see you off at the airport . 
8, People drive on the right in China . 
12,"Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ? "
16," Yes , bacon and eggs with buttered toast . I like my bacon very crisp . "
11, I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you . 
20, About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . 
28," I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? "
15," No , but if you can think of anything else , just get it . "
27," No , You can cut quite a bit off . I like it to be very short all over . Do you see what I mean ? "
19, I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars . 
12, I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say ? 
30," No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . "
20," Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ? "
12, Would you like me to tell you where I got mine . 
21," We might have a printer here next month . But for now , you'll have to go to the lab . "
31," I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . "
33," Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . "
12, You should have asked for my opinion before you did it . 
11, Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you ? 
39,Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . 
24," Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there . "
27, I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? 
34, That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
36," Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . "
12, Too bad I was busy . I really wanted to go . 
20, We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible . 
23," I am sorry , sir . You bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week . "
15," I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . "
77," Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . "
14," It just won't connect to a webpage , but it will pop up . "
13," Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full . "
15, We have beef with rice and fish with noodles . Which would you like ? 
23," Well , I am afraid I don't bring my passport with me today . Can you save it for us until tomorrow ? "
24," Thanks . You're in room 507 , a big , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . Is that okay , sir ? "
15," Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . "
18," Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ? "
23," Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him . "
17," Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . "
47," First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . "
14, Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ? 
14, You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet . 
45, I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late 
11, Only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak English . 
10, Would you like to go to dinner or something ? 
13," May I have your passport and form I - 94 , please ? "
10," No , Madam . I don't think I do . "
20," I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . "
39," Yes . That's true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . "
50," Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . "
56," We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . "
11,How many ports do we call at on our passage ? 
24," You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it "
30," ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . "
16," Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . "
14,"What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? "
44," First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . "
27," No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! "
22," Thank you . Your room number is 507 , queen bed , nonsmoking . Is that agreeable to you , sir ? "
30," No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it . "
13," Well , you ’ d better heat it before you eat it . "
16, Yes . I would like to cash my travelers ' check . Here you are . 
17, We assure you that shipment will be made no later than the first half of October . 
33," Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . "
60," So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . "
23," You can find the most fashionable restaurants there . And also you can see the galleries , antique shops and the ballrooms . "
26," Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ? "
61," Thank you , Mr . Johnson . You ’ Ve made a guaranteed reservation at the Guangzhou xx Hotel , from April 16th to 20th for 5 nights . If you can ’ t arrive as schedule , please inform us before 6 p . m . on April . hank you for calling and we look forward to serving you "
17," Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? "
112," Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! "
65," Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . "
21," Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! "
20," I'm afraid we don't have any . If I were you , I'd try one of the newspaper stands . "
27," Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them . "
30, I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 
8, Wow ! That car almost hit me . 
60," Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? "
22,"In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . "
25, Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! 
60," Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . "
25, No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
28," well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . "
10," Here , let me help you with your bags . "
20," Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit . "
11," May I have your name and room number , please ? "
10," Would you like it rare , medium or well-done ? "
15, I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . 
12,"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? "
26," First , she needs to be hard-working . Second , she has to be able to do a lot ot things on her own initiative . "
18, I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . 
17," Actually , I ’ m vegetarian so I ’ d like to have the bean curd . "
15, Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
43," I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . "
42," Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . "
17," I can't say , but let me make a call and see if I can help . "
15," If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal . "
18," Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . "
42, I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro 
13, Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved . 
7,Can you pass me the lighter ? 
39," That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! "
7,Do you have anything to declare ? 
12, Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ? 
17, I told you to hold my calls . I ’ m very busy at the moment . 
33," Trust me , it's worth it . With the "" Love , Amy Card "" , you'll get a 20 percent discount on everything in the store , every time you shop ! "
9, How long would you like to keep it ? 
17," I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . "
40, All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ? 
21," You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . "
28," Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! "
48," Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . "
46," Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on . "
81," I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . "
33,"Welcome to our factory . My name is Tiang Had and I'll show you around here.First we'll take a look at the workshop which produces food thermometers . Please , this way . "
35," First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . "
13,"I'm really sorry , but I seem to have misplaced your towel . "
18," Well , seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here , I'll let you go . "
47," Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . "
30," As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? "
31," I realize that . We don ’ t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ? "
32," If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time . "
21," Well , I ’ d like to , but I ’ m going to have to look at my schedule . "
21, I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant . 
39," Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . "
21," That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . "
24," Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . "
12,"Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ? "
30,"Thank you for your application , Mr . Sweeney . Mr . Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week . Do you have time ? "
17," I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours . "
23," There are thirteen of them . Oh , have another . Have a third , if you like , have them all . "
25," Well , the style is quite good , but I think it's too showy . I would like to try on the lighter one . "
11, Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
9, May I have a look at your receipt ? 
43," I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . "
35, It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? 
40," It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! "
34," Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . "
29," Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . "
12, And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . 
46," I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . "
36," Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? "
11,"Excuse me , I got a parcel arrival notice yesterday . "
18," No , ma'am . I ’ m afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime . "
11," Could you sign the back of the check , please ? "
16, Me too . Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ? 
46,"I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . "
20," Let's see , Mr . Horn ... The doctor's schedule is full today . Would tomorrow be all right ? "
16, But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . 
25," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! "
16, Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders . 
63," Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . "
14, Can she call you back ? She is about to start a meeting . 
48," Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . "
54,"OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people . "
23," Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . "
8," Okay , I'll make you some food . "
22," Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five . "
14,Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college . 
31, We are terribly sorry for that.Could you please buy a new one and give us the receipt ? We will refund the cost of the laundry and the new sweater . 
37," No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . "
20, Go to www.yahoo.com and click on Travel and tickets . There are about a billion sites to look at . 
21," Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! "
10,I'd like to rent a car for several days . 
22," Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . "
16, I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . 
26," That's right . We have to slow down again . If we haven't meet the passing tree , we have to stop a car away . "
27, This morning we rented a car and we are on the way to Niagara Falls . I'm afraid we have a car accident near the border . 
30," Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? "
15,"I need to get on another bus , but I have no more money . "
19," If you haven't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office . "
17, It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
21," The best opportunity is called callous , which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of . "
24," Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . "
60," So , it ’ s easy to get to the office from here . From your apartment , just drive along King Street East for about one kilometer and you ’ ll see a three-story blue building on your right . That ’ s the Department of Motor Vehicles building where you can change your driver ’ s license . "
15," No , it's not necessary . But you have to fill out this form . "
8," Yes , please bring us two steaks . "
35, That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus .

20,"Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! "

10, Would you like a savings or a chequing account ?

17, I'm afraid you'll need to have your visa extended before we can have you check in . 
19, May I see the room ? I'll take this room . Is the rate for a room only ? 
41," It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . "
52," I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . "
11," My husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and I . "
43," One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . "

16, I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ? 
17, I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing . 
17, I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates . 
29," yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? "
50," Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . "
24, We don ’ t want that . Well . perhaps will be begin with mushroom soap and follow by some seafood and chips . 
12," You bet , as long as I can collect enough money . "
12, Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ?

22,"Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ? "
51, Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . 
10, Would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ? 
27," Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? "

10, I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday . 
17," Well , would you please send someone to 502 ? I have some clothes to wash . "

20," No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . "
33," Fine , the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the Internet job listing sites . See them over there ? "
18," Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? "
20," Well , this company can be dated back to 1893 , so it has a hundred years of history . "
22," No , sometimes the test results aren ’ t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture . "
20, Yes . I am going to have a summer vacation . Would you recommend some scenic spots to see ? 
19, It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ? 
9, To the office . I'll be right back . 
64," After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . "
29," Sure . The first food you have is appetizer , followed by a soup . Then you will have the main course . The last dishes are desserts . "
42," Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . "
35," You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater . "
7," No , sir.Can I help you ? "
20," In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition . "
29, Yes . Everything is fine in the family . Don ’ t worry about the family . Just enjoy your trip . How ’ s the weather there ? 
20," Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . "
47," Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . "
37, I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . 
17, We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ? 
18, Do you know what the weather will be tomorrow ? We are planning to climb the mountain . 
25," Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? "
22, The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather . 
22, I am calling to tell you that the interview for you is in our company on Monday morning at 8: 00 . 
25," Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . "

10, Here's your boarding pass . Have a nice flight . 
41," hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . "
26," Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ? "
26, I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4

20," Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . "
21," Yes , I'll be with you in a minute . Here's your bill , sir . It's 480 yuan altogether . "
27," Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? "
49," This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . "
16,"We have a great variety of men's suits , sir.Which particular brand do you prefer ? "
21,"I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . "
39," Let me check and look at the map . Yes , there is an exit three quarters of a mile ahead . We ’ ll exit Market Street , head west , then get on the Pennsylvania Freeway . "
18," Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? "
21," As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence . "
15, I have to wear it this afternoon . Do you have a urgent service ? 
16," I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one . "
32," My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way . "
32," I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it . "
16, Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it . 
46," I bought a pair of trousers last year , which I like the best . But this year they don ’ t fit me very well . They ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . Can you make some alterations ? "
49," Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . "
19, I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . 
17," Yes , the food you have just sent here is cool.Would you please heat them up ? "
23," All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . "

49," Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . "
12, That's good . When can I go to see the house ? 
28, I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . 
28, You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . 
17," From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m . "
28, OK . You may wrap it now . Please fill in this form and label it . ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered ? 
19,Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . 
20,"Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ? "
32," That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . "
22," I can pick you up at the gate of your company . Also , what type of food do you like ? "
30," The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . "
26," Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf . "
14,I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . 
30," So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? "
56," I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . "
24," We have various kinds of wine . As for an appetizer , I advise you to order white wine or dry white wine . "
19, Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . 
16, I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
20, Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . 
110, I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days !

70," Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? "
23,"When we get paid for this assignment , you get US $ 2 , TOO , and I get US $ 3,000 . "

14,"Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? "
15," I ’ m not sure yet , but I plan to do good things . "
226," Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . "
8," No , thanks . I'm just looking . "

12, I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
18, I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons .

17," Oh , that's 39 dollars and 95 cents . It's on the sale at the moment . "
58,"Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . "

15, I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number . 
18," Yes , there have been a few problems recently . Why don't you call the IT department ? "
17, I know . Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like . 
36," No , not at all . I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning . "
11,Could you show me the way to the railway station ? 
73," Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . "
27," We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ? "
30, Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . 
30," Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? "
25," Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please . "

20," Perrier , Jim Beam , apples , and grape juice . It will all be there shortly , sir . "

26," Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . "

22," Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles . "
12,"Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? "
47," It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . "
26," You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . "
20, We're on clearance sale now . Prices have up to twenty percent off . Do not miss the chance . 
42, It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness .

28, Let ’ s call them right now . I am sure that they will be happy to hear that you have agreed to pay for the inspection . 
9,"Have you got anything to declare , madam ? "
21," Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes , companies have structures that define theirs ? "
41," This is for the delayed cancellation . Because this time is reserved for you . If you are unable to keep an appointment , you should notify us 48 hours in advance . Otherwise , the charge will be made . "
40," I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . "

37," Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference . "
37," I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . "
54," Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay . "
18," Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? "
45, Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . 
23, I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! 
32," I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? "
133," First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .

26," Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? "
22,"That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . "
29," Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well . "
21," Generally speaking , there are the company , the job title , job description , requirement , and so on . "
46," Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . "
17, We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain . 
21, I would love the help ! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing ?

If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . "
16, I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . 
27, Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment .

59," Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow .

Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . "
17," Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . "
34, I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help .

29," Yes . This is room 207 . There isn't any hot water in my bath room . Can you send somebody here , and do something about it ? "
76,"Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . "

18," Which kind of food do you like to eat , Chinese food , western food or seafood ? "
26," Just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . "

14," Yes , if any one is available . But not over the wing . "
38, Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . 
13, 500 in twenty dollar bills and the rest in a dollar bills . 
28," I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . "

27," Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg . "
64," Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . "
18, That's right . Can I get it back in the afternoon ? I really need them tonight . 
36, You don't have to . This is your knob menu.Just tick off the items you want for breakfast . write down the time and hang it outside the door before you go to bed tonight .

38," Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . "

10,"Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ? "
38," No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . "
9, Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ? 
71," It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . "

24,Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . 
83," Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week .

17,"Hi , Madam , I'm new here , could you tell me where is boarding gate ? "

76," It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante . "
95," I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama .

15, I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were .

They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! "
65," Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . "

40, Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine .

54," Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . "
60," Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . "
16," Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ? "
41," Let me see . The data documents with ' A ' and ' B ' are the drafts , and the ones with ' C ' and ' D ' are formal contracts . Do you know what I mean ? "
19, It doesn't matter . I can go with you to the supermarket to pick up a new pair . 
15," Yes , madam . There's one in the seat pocket . Here you are . "
10, What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
9,"Well , it was nice talking to you . "
15," It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? "
12,"I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ? "

67," Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . "
32," I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . "
11, Really ? The day after tomorrow ? That's very soon . 
18," Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . "
15," You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful . "
31," It's very quick and easy . It just takes 24 hours , we guarantee that . All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed . "

11," Well , that's too expensive . I can't afford that . "
22, No . Just some fun in the sun . We really need to get away and relax for a few days . 
13," Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food . "

46," Now , let me listen to your chest . Ah , you have a temperature . Breathe deeply . That's right . Well , don't worry , it's only a throat infection . There's nothing wrong with your lungs . And how is your appetite ? "

14," Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin . "
18," Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . "
37," I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . "
32, You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . 
16," Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . "

22," No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . "
13,"Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ? "
92," I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . "
11," Oh really , what kind of fruit do you like ? "
20, I just can't understand why you want to stay at home . It is such a wonderful day today . 
22,"While you are thinking about what you might like to order for dinner , would you like to order your drinks ? "

28," It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city , I don't think you would like to miss it . "
18," Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ? "
38," That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon . "
14," If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible . "
23," I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . "
81," Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . "
10," Oh , he's the coach of the football team . "
60," Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes .

43," Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise . "
30, For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? 
26," I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . "
59," OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! "
16," Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it . "
20," You can get a burger , or some Chinese food . Or maybe you can get some Mexican food . "
30," most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . "
13," You do know all the controls in the car , don't you ? "
15, I'll get all of that for you right away . Someone should be up shortly 
78," No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . "
33," I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ... "
13," No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ? "
20," No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . "
15, Is it really going to take that long ? Will you rush the order ? 
28," Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! "
30," I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I'll do it in a park . "
6,May I speak to Peter ? 
34, That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . 
10," Yes , it is . Thank you very much . "
13," Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think . "
14," Well , let's see . I'd like to go to the Summer Palace . "
25," You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . "
38, We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities . 
54," Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . "
14, I think maybe one day you can take part in the walking race . 
47, It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! 
19," Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ? "
15,Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go ! 
52," Oh , what a shame . Only sleeping cars have tickets . Others are all out of stock . The price of the sleeping car is almost the same as the airplane.You see , the discount plane tickets are no more than 500 yuan . A good deal , isn't it ? "
47," No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . "

43," Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge . "
16," Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . "
14, Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
25, I ’ m sorry . There ’ s nothing I can do about that . You ’ Ve got to call the phone company . 
10,"It was good to see you here , John . "
23, We have express service as well . It charges 30 % more but I assure your coat will be ready tomorrow morning . 
20," Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but I don't know how to write it . "

31," It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . "

15," Yes , you came here on the right day . They're on sale today . "
29, I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . 
25,"This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . "
18," Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . "
34," It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . "
19," Sorry , Mr . Wood is not here right now . Do you have any message for him ? "
9,"Are you ready to order now , sir ? "
46," If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . "
27,I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ? 
12, You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value . 
17," I bought the MP4 in your store a week before , but it doesn't work today . "
13,"Excuse me , What time does the next bus for Boston leave ? "

16," We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor . "
57, I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . 
10, I have a sweet tooth . I want candy . 
25," It's a priority seat . We can not sit there . We should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people . "

34," Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff.and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? "
35," If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . , there is a saver return which is 9 pounds . An ordinary return is 16 pounds . "
24," Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . "
24, I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . 
35," I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . "
47,"Good morning , Mr.Robinson . I am afraid there is a change in today's program . I just got word that your appointment with Mr . Smith , the general manager of Western Textile Co . , Ltd . , will have to be put off . "
25," Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge . "
61," You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time . "

13, That ’ s my final offer . Take it or leave it . 
18,"Hello , this is Mary from the Taipei new station , what can i do for you ? "
25, The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here . 
9," Oh , honey , you made a mistake . "
29," All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow . "
44," First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . "
25," Mike , I enjoyed your company , but I am getting ready to graduate soon . I really need to focus on my studies . "
21," Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? "
33," Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . "
23," Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . "

16," Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . "
22," Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . "
28," Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . "
83," Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . "
19, Sure . It ’ s on basement level one . Turn right when you get off the elevator . 
11,"What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ? "
35," ( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ? "
30, Nope . Our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . We don't think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making . 
24, My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! 
31," Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . "
34," That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us . "
31," Hmm . It may be those then , especially if they were raw . Well , I ’ ll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow . "
33," Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now . "
24," Yes , the lift is just around the corner.You can go up first , and your luggage will be brought up straight away . "
12, You can try it on in the fitting room over there . 
21," I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . "
15,"Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ? "
23," Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . "
45," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . "
28, Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 
38," Let ' s see . These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about . "

12, All right . I'm nearly ready.What time does the bus leave ? 
18,"Good ! There's the information desk . How do we get to the 70th Street , please ? "
23, I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
13, This is Room 320 . Can I have a morning call tomorrow ? 
17,Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . 
22," Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters . "
14,I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible . 
24, I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
25, A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan . 
34, Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . 
12," You like it . Well , I'll gather it for you . "
21," Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now . "
20,I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
15," I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . "
31," I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too . "

13, Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well . 
35," Here you go . We have your cocktail and there're salad . fried chicken , French fries and vanilla ice cream for dessert . Eat the chicken while it's hot . It tastes better . "
34, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
26," John , I'm hard up at the moment . Could you lend me five hundred yuan ? I'll return it to you early next month . "
26, Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .

16, There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief !

30," You're welcome ! By the way , you'd better booked in the Internet or the telephone next time and then you kow whether there are rooms available or not . "
19," Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . "
44, I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do .

12, I don't think I ever wanted to be a bus driver . 
23," OK , sir . We offer two types of lunch , Chinese food and western food . Which one would you prefer ? "
29," Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . "
44," certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique "
17," Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . "
21,"The client you're meeting tomorrow likes to ask a lot of questions , so you have to be well prepared . "
21," Don ’ t worry , madam . I guess we should get there not later than 1:30 p . m . "
23, We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . 
110," My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . "
23," Could I possibly have a room change ? My room is right next to the street , and it's much too noisy . "
20, Come on ! It ’ ll be fun . We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August . 
8, And how much is the coca cola ? 
14," Yes , we ’ Ve got a reservation . The name is Ann . "

11, I ’ m going to work at the polling place . 
27," 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 150 ? "

8,When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? 
27," Will you fill out this form , please ? The bellboy will show you up to your room . Your luggage will be brought right up . "
17," That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? "
14," Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ? "

11, I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
20," Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . "
18, What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ...

14,"Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . "
35," Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? "
74," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
7,"Passport and disembarkation card , please . "
26," You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . "
31, Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel .

17, Here is my member card . Can I have someone carry those bags to my car ? 
13," Mm , I just need something about business news.Can you recommend some ? "
14, I don't know . Check the flyer or check with the produce person .

14,I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . 
10, She's one of the prettiest girls at the school . 
13, What are you going to do about the money in your account ? 
18," Then , perhaps a leather belt would work . Come here . Let me show you some . "
24,Excuse me . I think I have got lost in the Art Gallery . Can you tell me the way to the exit . 
23,"Excuse me , waiter . Could we change our table for that one ? My wife is quite interested in the scenery . "
16," The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? "

15," Of course I know it , but you know it's hard to quit smoking ... "
20," I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . "

14, I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years . 
42, You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small .

24," They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . "
11," Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . "

10,Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? 
21,"Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? "

37," I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . "
13,Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? 
55," OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives . "
20, I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ? 
45," Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . "
14,"Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . "
44," Let ’ s see . We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month . "
22,"Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . "
13,This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 
51," I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . "
6,May I use your phone ? 
15, We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr.Chen will know why I'm calling . 
9," Hold on , I ’ ll get her . "
23," Thanks . Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here . Would you mind checking , please ? "
23," Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . "
10, Will you be paying some of that off today ? 
20," Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places . "
32," Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . "
49," Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . "
33," yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting . "
21, All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . 
35," well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . "
27," 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . "
39," Sorry to keep you waiting , Miss . I'll have a dresser Mr.Li is just finish with a client in a moment or two . Would you have a shampoo first ? I'll get it on for you . "
19," come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . "
53," Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! "
12, I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? 
42," You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . "
12," Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . "
19," Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please . "
53," The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . "
12,"Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? "
30," Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . "
26," Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision . "
18, You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
20," Well , we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do ? "
19," Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . "
50," All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! "
29," Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them . "
28," Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it . "
29," Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . "
20," Please give me this extra value meal , a red bean pie , and one order of vegetable salad . "
20, I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 
16," Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball . "
31," Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me . "
15," You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . "
11, I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit . 
23, I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 
41," Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . "
26,"I just called Mr . Smith in Room 201 , but there was no reply . Would you find out if he's still staying there ? "
15," Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? "
13,"Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? "
73," I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . "
17," Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here . "
9, I ’ m in need of your services . 
32," Sure , sir . But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class . Would you please refer to this price list ? And then give me your order . "
17, Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please . 
23," Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this . "
13," It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket . "
10, Those are something gifts I bought for my friends . 
34,"Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . "

7,I'm going to the pub tonight . 
18," No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . "
37," I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . "
19, Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
11, Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty . 
37, Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
28," I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? "
30," Very good . You will normally be sent an official notification of the results of your interview by post . Once you get the notification , you can come . "
11, Can I try it on and see how it looks ? 
44," No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . "
11, Bring us a bottle of Remy Martini and red wine . 
21," Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . "
24," You're all set . That's a double room for the twenty-fourth , twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth of June , in the name of Hamlin . "
41," The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . "
23,"Good morning , Family . We'll have our board meeting this afternoon . Can you write the agenda on the notice board ? "
35, I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . 
36," Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . "
24," Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . "
23,"Seat 30B is right here , sir . You may take your seat . I'll put your bag in the above compartment . "
38," Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . "
16, I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ? 
13," It's on the south wall of the store , in aisle A . "
7,"That'll be eight dollars , please . "
32," Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . "
18, Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . 
15,"Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed . "
24, Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him . 
10, I stopped you for driving through a red light . 
39, Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
25, About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days . 
40," I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . "
14,"I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room . "
16, I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . 
28," ( Pause a few seconds ) They say Mr . Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends . "
34," First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . "
12, I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes . 
13," No , sir . Would you rather sit near the dance floor ? "
35," OK . You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each , and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . That makes a total of 660 US dollars . "
9, Why don't you call back later this afternoon ? 
16," No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry . "
30," Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter . "
22, Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college .

17," Yes , we give 5 % discount for a week and 12 % for 2 weeks . "
10," Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . "
31," That's all . Here's your bank card , and here's the certificate of deposit . Bring your bank card with you every time you come to deposit or withdraw money . "
26," That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy.Will he be back soon ? "
15," Oh , I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow . "
74," Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . "
16,"By the way , can you tell me where I can find a restaurant not ? "
34, You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . 
22, Don't worry . The bus tour is really worth while . You can enjoy the whole city in a single day .

11, It's very sturdy . You get what you pay for . 
21," ... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model . "
41," Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? "
19, Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . 
8,"Hello , do you have any vacancies ? "
36," Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . "

14,Do you know a bus I can take from Altadena to downtown LA ? 
74," I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . "
12," Yes , I ’ m looking for a pair of trousers . "
9,Who's the man that is kicking the boy ?

12," Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time . "
26," Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts . "
45," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . "
86," Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . "
19, I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet.How do I look ? Is my make-up ok ?

25," Oh , you read ? Very good . Then , I think we should do something different today . I'll give you some privilege . "
13," Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? "
16, Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it . 
21,"Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise . "
25," The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . "
24," In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . "
15, Okay . Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? 
10, I have no idea where to get it from . 
11," Okay , I'll get the car out of the garage . "
34," I would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs . "

If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you . "
33," Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . "

25, This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . 
69," There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . "

23," I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . "
60," It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty .

21," No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . "
78," First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur . "

11," Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ? "
15, It fits fine . I ’ ll take it . How much is it ? 
7,Why are there so many people ? 
60," Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit .

18,"I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job "
17, Yes . I locked myself out . May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 201 ? 
32," Well , sir . According to today's exchange rate , every pound in cash is equivalent to 1.89 U . S . dollars . How much would you like to change ? "
87," They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . "

71," I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden .
