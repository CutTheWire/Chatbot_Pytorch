22, You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from . 
32," I'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . How long will it take ? "

14," Yes , here you are . Try it in front of the mirror . "
11, Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen . 
59," I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! "
23, Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 . 
22," Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ? "

10, I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
14,"Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ? "
21, You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough . 
38," You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great ! "
28, I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .

18," I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . "
10,"What do you think I should do , doctor ? "
14, You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork . 
23," I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ? "
43," You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet.You must stay in bed for another two days.The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food . "
56," Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . "
31," Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu . "
17, It ’ s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ’ s good for you ! 
22," Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . "
28,I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
18," Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right . "
56," I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so . "
51," I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . "
23," That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready . "

11, What day would you like us to do the installation ? 
12, Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains . 
10,"Can we have a table for three , please ? "
26," For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . "
25," Hey . I just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . Let's work out on arms and stomach today . "

17," Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ’ t you ? "
17," Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 . "
13," Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? "
118," No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . "
55," We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ? "

28, Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
47," Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . "
17," Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? "
11," I plan to , but what day is the election ? "
21," We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . "
12," Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . "
22," Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ? "
20, Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety . 
44," I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . "
16," If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . "
29," What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . "
28," Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . "
23," You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! "
47," Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . "
63," I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . "
23," I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . "
18, I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . 
41," Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . "
32," Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights . "
35," Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . "
45," Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight . You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted . "
19," Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . "

12, Cross the street and walk two blocks west.You can't miss it . 
16,I would like to buy a bottle of cleansing milk.Can you recommend me some kinds ? 
7, You must have the wrong number .

30," Let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . "
33, I've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . But the line has been engaged all the time . Why is it taking so long ? 
11,Let's have seafood for a change.How about oyster and lobster ? 
33," No problem . I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . And here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . Please board the plane at Gate 15 . "
49," I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . "
27," You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . "

73," Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . "
28," I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? "
26," So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ? "
15," Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ? "
17, Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age . 
18,I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . 
11,"Would you pour me some of that tea , please ? "
20," Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . "
37," All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % . "
22," But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor ! "
37, Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left . 
11," I really wanted you to come , but I understand . "
46," Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . "
23,Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .

23," you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . "
17," Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . "
18," Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? "
22, I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .

46," I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . "
19,Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ?

29," Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . "
7, Sorry . I'll clean it up . 
16, We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ? 
28, Hi . I've been sent over from Turner Interiors . They said I need to collect some sort of L / C ? Do you have it ?

12,"Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? "
22," We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . "
16," But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too . "
59," That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . "
14," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir . "
17," Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . "
19," It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . "
21,"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . "
45," Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! "

21, I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . 
24," You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . "
49," No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? "
36," It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . "

15," I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . "

26," No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . "
17, I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”

39," I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . "
73," No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . "
74," You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . "
10,"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . "
12, What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .

If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . "
12, I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? 
13,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? 
22, We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .

47," OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . "
13, We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .

22, Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? 
15, I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
10," Yes , I can , but not very well . "
8," Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? "
33," Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . "
24," My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . "
21, No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . 
11,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 
14, I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . 
93," I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . "
65," That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . "
62," Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . "
32," Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . "
47, But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
38," Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . "
20," Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . "
11, Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . 
16, I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
15, But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . 
42,"Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . "
14, I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . 
23, No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 
22," He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . "
25," I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . "
21," Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
21," No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . "
42," certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch "
21,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
42,"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . "
12, No . The best thing to do is just stay home . 
20,"I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . "
9,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .

26," Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . "
14,I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days . 
26, I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . 
19, Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . 
27, Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 
12,"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . "
17,"Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ? "
14,"I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . "
18, What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? 
48," Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . "
27," Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else . "
22, And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 
29, Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die . 
50," Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . "
29,"Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . "
36," If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . "
27, Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
22, Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart . 
33, You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
42," He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . "
39, It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
36, The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . 
17," No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along . "
44," OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . "
10, Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
32," $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... "
8,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
26, How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense . 
42," it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . "
23," No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . "
15, En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . 
18,"I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago . "
16, He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . 
11," But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . "
15, And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . 
14,Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ? 
9,What are you going to do next year ? 
23,"Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . "
13, Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . 
13,"The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ? "
11, What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . 
26," It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . "
30,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . "
16,We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? 
48," Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' "
13,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . "
6,May I ask a question ? 
16, ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . 
25," Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends . "
17, Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it . 
37," Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . "
23," She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . "
20," You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... "
31,"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . "
16," Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . "
37, Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? 
41," Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . "
28, That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
14," No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . "
8, Thank you very much for your kindness . 
41," I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . "
28, His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . 
13,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
22, I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? 
54," I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . "
36," you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . "
10, But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . 
8, I don't know . Something rotten here ? 
28," They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . "
38," no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . "
21," Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! "
45," Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! "
39," Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . "
25, Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? 
32, I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . 
16, Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . 
25," Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . "
23," Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? "
11,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! 
16, I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . 
12," Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . "
18," Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . "
26, Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
20," Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! "
41," Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! "
35," Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . "
10,"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . "
25, But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . 
18,Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? 
24," Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . "
25," actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? "
31," I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . "
20, She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 
18,"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . "
16," Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . "
17," Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? "
21," That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . "
66," Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . "
13, I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
33," I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . "
40, I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . 
7,I can't go to your party . 
21," You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . "
4,Have you eaten ? 
11, But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
13, Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
13,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? "
6, Okay . Keep in touch . 
58," I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . "
9,Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
50,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
27," I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! "
43," Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . "
30," Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . "
4,You're looking great . 
26, It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . 
13," Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . "
36, I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? 
18,"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . "
14, Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . 
18, So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . 
53," I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . "
20," Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . "
20,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . "
42," My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . "
46," I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . "
16," Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? "
27," when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? "
34," Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . "
12, No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . 
14, I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . 
29, Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . 
12, Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . 
3,Who's that ? 
47," Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? "
24," No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . "
23, Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . 
15, And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
32," Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . "
32," I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . "
14, Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . 
18," Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . "
11,Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . 
23," Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . "
23, You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
26," Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . "
22, It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
40," Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . "
11, I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . 
50," Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? "
26, The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? 
14,The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . 
10, Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
33," It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . "
19," It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . "
18, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
15," She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . "
34," Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? "
15," Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? "
105," Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . "
14, She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . 
13, How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . 
24," O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . "
35, Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 
18," Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? "
18," Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . "
7, He can barely make ends meet . 
13," If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . "
29, How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
21," In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . "
33," Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . "
70," Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . "
37," Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? "
13," Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . "
43," I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . "
8, It's a good day for a picnic . 
14," Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "
19, I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . 
24," No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . "
18," Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . "
19, It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
15," I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . "
13," Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! "
9, But you'll miss out on the football game . 
18, But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . 
5,I had an accident . 
19,"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . "
11,"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . "
20, That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . 
7, What for ? ( Why ? ) 
42," Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . "
24, Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
23," Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? "
9,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
20,"What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . "
15, Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . 
63," There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . "
11," Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . "
21, Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . 
17," Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? "
67," You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! "
14, That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . 
26," That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . "
14," As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . "
15," Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . "
30," OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . "
24," Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? "
6,Do you have a minute ? 
18,"Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? "
7, My domicile place is Hebes Province . 
12,I know you have a son . How old is he ? 
19, Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . 
19," Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . "
31," Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . "
