        "input": "I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry. I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think \"people should\" do. What you would REALLY do. \n\nI'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. \n\nWe were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. \n\nAnd what he is, is nothing. \n\nHe doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby.\n\nHe has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. \n\nI'm not upset because I got a special needs/\"imperfect\" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get *a child*. \n\nI don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him. \n\nOur older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. \n\nThe final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming \"You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!\" \n\nInstead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all. \n\nHe breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. \n\nHe doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my \"child\". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. \n\nAnd so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone. \n\nHe's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words \"I don't want my son in my home\" either. \n\nHe's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. \n\nI just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like Downs*. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were \"99% sure it was Downs\". \n\nThis post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just \"decided\" it was. \n\nIf anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the \"freak industrial accident\" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. \n\nAs for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care. \n\nAs for \"mistaking\" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a \"strong puff\". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. \n\nSo, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? Care to admit I *just might be* telling the truth? There were identify details I left out but guess y'all need them.",

        "input": "Cop pulled me over and I called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail. When I was 19 I was running late to work in my tiny POS economy car and on fumes of gas I didn’t come to a complete stop on a right turn. Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die. \n\nAt the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind. \n\nWell as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there. \n\nSo I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up. \n\nAbout 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store. \n\nPushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. \n\nI was an idiot and I confess!\n\nEdit: Wow, this blew up.  I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it.  Because I’m an idiot!\n\nSo it wouldn’t have been just a few mins late to work. The job was a physical high turn over one that didn’t tolerate much.\n\nThank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards!

        "input": "I used to bully my disabled brother for years UPDATE:\n\nA lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.\n\nI wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.\n\nI knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying \"I wanted to say I'm really sorry\" and just couldn't get through it.\n\nI just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said \"I missed you buddy\".\n\nI fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck.\n\nI thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway.\n\nI am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again.\n\nI have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18).\n\nI also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing.\n\nI received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.\n\n\n\n\nMy actual post:\n\n[Remorse]\n\n\nI know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash.\n\nI just need to get this out.\n\nI have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either.\n\nWe used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under.\n\nI had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it.\n\nThere was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.\n\nI realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him.\n\nI stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.\n\nI started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.\n\nIt started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.\n\nI would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach.\n\nI would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me?\n\nBut my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it.\n\nThree weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours.\n\nWhen I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated. \n\nI have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.\n\nI stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed.\n\nLast Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried.\n\nI'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck.\n\nI'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years.\n\nMy brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.\n\nI am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",

When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) \nThe way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. \n\nSo my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. \nMy manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. \n\nOver the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. \n\nAfter the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. \n\nI bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.\nAnd for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones. \n\nEdit:\n\nHoly crap this blew up.  Here are the answers to some of the FAQs\n\n1. We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  Both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.  \n\n\n2. The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.  \n\n\n3. The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.  \n\n\n4. Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them.  E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756.\n\n5.  When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  They were not coupons.  \n\n6.  One can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",

I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.\n\nOne nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.\n\nI was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house.  It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  But when I looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.\n\nI didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.\n\nWhen I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done.\n\nI sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long.  The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years.  We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.\n\n\n  After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  I went down a dark path the years after that.  I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job.  Even tried to kill myself with pills.  It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order.  Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there.   It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again.  I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWow, you guys are awesome! Thanks for the support and feedback.

I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now. \n\nI disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism. \n\nSoon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. \n\nFor the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. \n\nThen I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. \n\nAnyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed. \n\nIts been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it. \n\nI don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like \"why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?\" kind of tension. \n\nI think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child. ",

She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. \n\nMy Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her. \n\nSo back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks.\n\nMy heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone. \n\nWe told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped. \n\nI can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about.\n\nBut should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.  \n\nMy Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things.

        "input": "I stood by and allowed my wife to almost kill our son. I was happy she did it. Okay, fair warning, this one is long as hell. Apologies for that, but this is very hard for me and I have been carrying it for a lot of years. On the advice of my therapist, I’ve written it all out to try to work out my feelings on it. He didn’t advise me to submit it to Reddit of course, but I have struggled with this for a long time, and I need to hear other people’s opinion on it. I still really have no idea how I feel about it, even after all these years, but I will submit for judgment by the masses. I know I did wrong on some things, probably a lot of things. I tried to do my best that I could.\n\nMy son was very troubled. VERY troubled. If you have seen the movie \"We Need To Talk About Kevin\", it will really help to understand what I'm talking about, because I swear to God when I watched that film I thought I was watching a documentary of my life, I felt like the writer must have had cameras hidden in my damn house, that’s how accurate it was. The only difference is that in the movie, the boy appears normal to his father and only reveals his true nature to his mother, with my son he didn’t have that mask. His insane behavior was the same with everyone.\n\nFrom the day he was born, my son just came out wrong. He was planned, my wife and I tried to get pregnant and were ecstatic when he was born. He was wanted and loved. We showered affection on him and really tried to give him a happy childhood. But from the day we brought him home from the hospital, he was miserable. He cried for 13 months straight. I’m not exaggerating, 13 months without a break, he cried until he had no voice left and kept crying, you could see his little face scrunched up and no sound coming out, totally hoarse. There were times he would literally be crying in his sleep, I’ve never seen or heard of any other kid able to do that. We brought him to doctors, specialists, tried changing his diet, held him, rocked him, toys, swaddling, music, mobiles, everything we could think of. Nothing worked. 13 months of grating, grinding, no sleep hell.\n\nOnce he got over the crying stage, we thought we were out of the woods. But it quickly became clear that for some unknown reason, he was just angry at being alive. I never saw that kid have a genuine, joyous smile once in the time I knew him. I saw him grin a vicious, horrible grin many times, taking a perverse pleasure from causing pain or suffering or breaking a rule, but a smile from real pleasure at something nice? No, never. Not once. He had no interest in anything positive; he was fueled by hate, and everything he did was bent toward that.\n\nAs soon as he could walk, his mission in life was to destroy things. He would break or try to break anything that came in his range, smash it, chew it, throw it in the toilet, whatever he could. After a while he figured out how to get his diaper off and took great pleasure in shitting and pissing anywhere he could. After a while he figured out he could hide it, and started pissing and shitting in places we wouldn’t find right away, grinding it into carpets making it even more of a problem to clean and making the house stink. When he got older, (ages 9-15) he would piss and shit in our bed, until we got a lock on our door and he wasn’t able to get in anymore; then he’d just take a dump in the hallway in front of our room. That biological warfare started around a 2 and a half years old and he never grew out of it.\n\nI’ll try to speed it up as I could literally go on for days about this stuff, but as he grew older, he became more and more unmanageable. He would bite, kick, scream, scratch and spit at anyone trying to do anything with him. He was kicked out of school twice before he was 9, then let him back in and then kicked him out for good, he had to change schools. The next one put him in a special class that kept him away from the other students. We had to install a door and lock on the kitchen because he would steal knives and use them to gouge the walls/furniture or chase people with them. When he was 10, he stabbed me pretty good in the hip and ass, I still have the scars. As he grew older, he grew darker. He moved into setting things on fire, and torturing local animals. There was a stray dog that hung out around the park near our house, my son blinded it in one eye with a BBQ fork. He would dip cat’s tails in gasoline and light them on fire. He became a violent, stinking, vicious beast that lived in our house. We couldn’t do anything with him.\n\nI will take this opportunity to preempt the tsunami of messages: YES, we had the kid in fucking therapy. He saw a psychiatrist twice a week, and had god knows how many different medications prescribed to him over the years. Nothing worked. Therapy didn’t work. Meds didn’t work. Nothing fucking worked. He was like a poison cloud of hate and fury lashing out at anything in his reach.\n\nWhen my son was 16, my wife got pregnant again. I can’t tell you how different our reaction was. Instead of joy, we felt horror. This pregnancy had not been planned, and we really were at a loss over what to do. My son had been such an unending nightmare for 16 years, we couldn’t take the idea of starting again from the beginning. We talked a lot about terminating, but a) access to abortion was not as easy in those days as it is now, and b) my wife was very against it. We talked about many options. In the end, we decided that my wife would have the baby, and if it turned out evil we would put it up for adoption. We knew we just couldn’t do it again with another child like our son.\n\nWe had a daughter. She was normal. Suddenly we saw what our lives should have been like the whole time, how things would have been had our son not been himself. She laughed at things. She breast fed without biting (she didn’t have teeth yet anyway, but you could tell she was just trying to eat, not tear her mom’s breast off). After 4 months she was sleeping through the night. She was happy. She was NORMAL. I can’t describe the relief and happiness that we both felt, I don’t have the words for it.\n\nThis where I believe I may have started really pulling back from my son. Up until that time, whatever mistakes I made, I had always tried to do the best for my son, I am convinced of that. I tried to help him and love him and care for him, I really tried. But when my daughter was born, my wife and I both instinctively just turned toward her. She became our focus, not from malice, but just because she was so much EASIER. She was so happy and sweet, every moment we were with her was like magic. I understand this was wrong, but we honestly couldn’t help it. I don’t have a better explanation than that.\n\nMy son hadn’t given a shit about my wife being pregnant, I honestly don’t know if he really understood it, but when we brought our daughter home he started acting out even more. I didn’t think it was possible, but he took it up another notch. At this time he was 17, and we were having blow-out screaming matches daily. Usually after we fought, he would storm out of the house and disappear for hours at a time, or come back the next morning. It was a relief. I started to actually look forward to our fights because it would get him away from us for a while.\n\nAfter the birth of our daughter, my relationship with my son was almost entirely gone, our only real interactions were screaming at each other. My wife was even worse with him, she just had nothing left. By that time, if our son even came in to the same room as her, she would just stop whatever she was doing and start screaming “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY! GET THE FUCK OUT!” until he left. He started spending more and more time out of the house, which was a blessing for us. I have no idea what he got up to out in the world, but we were just happy it wasn’t being inflicted on us.\n\nAs a consequence of our son’s behavior, we had invested heavily in locks around our house. All of the cheap, thin interior doors in our home had been replaced with think, dense wood doors that couldn’t be kicked through, equipped with keyed locks that my wife and I carried keys to. I know it sounds extreme, but locks and heavy doors were the best way we had found to create safe spaces from him. And again, before I am inundated with messages, I was not locking my son in rooms like a prisoner, he had free reign of the house and could come and go as he pleased. My wife and I would lock OURSELVES in rooms to protect ourselves from him, if anything WE were the prisoners in our own home.\n\nOn the day in question, I had fought with my son in the morning and he had left the house in a rage. My wife and I were enjoying some peace and quiet in the kitchen while our daughter napped in our bedroom. And then my daughter began crying. Any parent who has young children can tell you, you get used to your child’s cries and you can tell after a while what they need, they cry differently if they are hungry, or need changing, or are just restless and want to be held. Babies can communicate pretty well before they can speak. This cry was none of those things. This cry was terror. The second we heard it my wife and I were both up out of our chairs and running to the room. The door was locked of course, and it took a few seconds to get the right key and get it open.\n\nMy son was in the room. We lived in a bungalow, and the bastard had climbed in the window to get to her. He was standing over her crib with a steak knife in his hand. I have no idea where he got it, it wasn’t one of ours; we controlled our knives very carefully and always kept them in locked drawers. I think he may have stolen it from one of our neighbor’s houses. He had broken her skin twice already, once in the belly area and once on her arm. I could see blood running down. When I entered the room he was dragging the back of the knife down her face, not cutting, almost tickling her with it, teasing her while she screamed. He looked up at us and smiled.\n\nBefore I knew what I was doing, I was already moving, running to put myself between them. I didn’t think about it, I just moved instinctively. Even with that, my wife got there faster, it was like a movie on fast forward, she got to our son and bashed his hand away, knocking the knife across the room and then shoved him with her whole body weight, so hard that he flew away from the crib and bounced off the wall. I picked up my daughter and held her while my wife screened us. I could see her shaking, almost convulsing. I can remember the smell of the room, the sound of my daughter screaming and wailing. The look on my son’s face as he stood there. Just nothing. Blank, dead, there was nothing in his eyes, no emotion. He looked like an alien to me. I watched my wife take a step toward him. I could have reached out and stopped her, but I didn’t. She stepped forward again, very close to him. I could have stopped her again. But I didn’t. She waited, looking at him for maybe 3 to 5 seconds without moving. And then she punched him in the face.\n\nNow until this point, you may have been picturing my wife as a typical woman, small frame, dainty, delicate. This is not the case. My wife does have a small frame, but dainty and delicate she is not, never has been since I’ve known her. Since her early teens, my wife has been a boxer. MMA didn’t exist back then, but karate and boxing were big in those days, and my wife was a VERY talented amateur. She was about 130 pounds, she carried a lot of muscle and she knew how to punch. I had 70 pounds on her back then, and I have no doubt that in a real fight between me and her she could have and would have pounded me flat. Neither of us had ever laid a hand on our son in anger before, but something broke in her that day, and all the years of anger and pain and sorrow and frustration just came pouring out. When she hit him his head snapped back and blood started pouring out of his nose. He hardly reacted, he just looked at her with this shocked expression like he didn’t know how to process what had just happened. She waited another second. And then she hit him again.\n\nI could have reached out and stopped her. I could have dragged her out of the room, taken her away, calmed her. I didn’t. I just stood there and watched while she systematically started to pound him to a pulp. Every time he brought his hands to cover one part she would blast him somewhere else, body, head, body, head, over and over. He started screaming, crying out, yelling for her to stop. It’s the most genuine reaction I’d ever seen him have to anything in his whole life. But she wasn’t stopping. I watched her ramping up, hitting harder, faster, working him like a heavy bag. He tried to swing at her and she slipped him easily. She was on auto pilot, sinking down into her training. I stood there watching for a minute. Then I turned my back on them and took my daughter out of the room.\n\nI brought my daughter to the kitchen and gave her a bath in the sink. I found that he had cut her a third time on the sole of her foot. All the cuts were superficial. I cleaned her up and held her until she calmed. I put Polysporin and Band-Aids on her cuts. In our bedroom, I could hear my son screaming, calling my wife horrible names, telling her he would cut her head off and fuck her corpse. After a while, I didn’t hear him saying anything anymore, didn’t even hear him crying out. I assumed that he must have been knocked out. But I could still hear her beating him.\n\nThat went on for a long time. Long enough for my daughter to drift off to sleep in my arms. I just sat at the kitchen table waiting for her to finish. Finally she came out and sat down across from me. Her hands were swollen and red. Her face and arms were splattered with blood. Her chest was heaving. We just stared at each other without saying anything. After a while I asked her “Is he dead?” She looked back at me and answered “I fucking hope so”. I nodded. That was all there was to say about that. I understood how she felt perfectly. I felt the same. I didn’t know what to do, so we just sat there waiting silently. Eventually my wife started crying and went to go take a shower. I just stayed where I was holding our daughter.\n\nAfter a long while, I heard moaning and sobbing coming from our room. It turned out that my son wasn’t dead. I went in to see how bad it was, and it was… pretty bad. I’ve never seen a more merciless beating laid onto anyone, before or since. He was lying on the floor, rolling around with blood leaking out of his face, lying in a pool of vomit. His nose was squashed flat out across his face, both of his eyes were completely swollen shut and starting to blacken already. I could see that a couple of his fingers were bent out at weird angles and he had pissed his pants. I think he must have been missing teeth, but I couldn’t see any on the floor and I couldn't see inside his mouth, his lips were all puffed up and swollen. From talking to my wife about it later, I know now that she had systematically beaten every part of his body, focusing heavily on his legs. She told me she kicked him in the groin repeatedly until her legs got tired, and had kept beating his body long after he had passed out.\n\nWhen my wife came out of the shower, I still didn’t know what to do about our son. I didn’t know whether to call the police or an ambulance, take him to the hospital myself, I honestly didn’t have any idea what to do. After a while I realized that I simply didn’t care what happened to him anymore, and we decided to just let him live or die on his own. There was an in-law suite in the basement that we had never really used, and my wife, my daughter and I just moved down there. We simply ceded the top floor of the house to my son and locked everything down, separated our lives entirely. There was plenty of food in the upstairs cabinets, enough for a couple weeks or more, he had a washroom and bedrooms to use. We had a washroom in the basement, a small kitchenette, and a separate entrance so we just stopped going upstairs. We just decided we were done with him. I figured we'd let his food run out and see what happened.\n\nOver the next week we could hear him moving around upstairs sometimes. I think he just spent most of time lying in bed recovering. I went to work, watching on high alert in case he attacked me in the driveway, but he never did. My wife stayed home with our daughter. She was never out of our sight. One night we heard him going ballistic, smashing things and banging. We didn’t respond. He never tried to get downstairs or get near us though. I think he was afraid that if he got near us again, my wife might finish the job on him. After three weeks down in the basement, we hadn’t heard anything from up above for a few days, and I ventured upstairs to the main floor of the house.\n\nThe place was demolished, and there was no sign of my son. He was gone. It took months to repair the damage he had done and get the main floor back to normal again. There was food and shit smeared all over the walls and broken glass on the floor, big holes in the dry wall, he had ripped the place apart. He tore up the linoleum in a corner of the kitchen and emptied an entire foam fire extinguisher into the living room. I feel thankful that he didn't burn the house down with us in it, I'm honestly not sure why he didn't, the kid wasn't shy about lighting things on fire. After that, I lived in fear every day that he would come back, that he would ambush us out of the blue and try to kill us. We moved house about 3 years later and I finally stopped being afraid that he would show up again, as now he had no idea where we were. I finally felt safe from him.\n\nAll this happened a long time ago. My son was born in the spring of 1971, my daughter was born in ’88. I'm an old man now, I’ll be 70 this year and my wife passed from cancer in 2016. My daughter is 31 now, I moved in with her and her husband after my wife passed. I’ve got two granddaughters and they are the joy of my life. I see a therapist a couple times a month to talk about all this. I don’t know where my son is. The last time I saw him was when he was lying on the floor of our bedroom, bleeding and smashed. I haven’t heard from him since he left, more than 30 years now. I don’t want to.\n\nI carry a lot of guilt from that time, and a lot of conflicted emotions. I didn’t beat him myself, but I allowed him to be beaten, and I thought he deserved it. I was happy it happened. I didn’t try to kill him, but I would have been happy if he died. I will say that I do hope he was able to overcome his demons and go live a normal life somewhere. If he wasn’t able to do that, if he stayed the way he was, then I truly do hope someone out there killed him. When I knew him he was a rabid dog, and whichever way it went I just hope he isn’t still out there hurting anyone else.",

I am an English woman.  Living in England.  About 2 years ago the fate that is called life landed an American guy in my local pub.  My first impression was that he was different and a little odd.  I was drawn to this oddness.  It was cool and exciting and it brings out my personality and inner quirks.  About a year ago we have become the best of friends.  It’s platonic and it’s amazing.  It’s a friendship like no other.    Well, of course being a typically reserved English woman I had never heard of Reddit.  The guy, who shall be known as Mr X obviously is a hardcore Redditer and has an established account.   He told me about Reddit suggesting I set up an account and bet that I could never achieve the same amount of Karma as him.    I think it was more the smug grin on his face as he was looking down at me that had the greatest impact and made me more so determined.  What I don’t think he realised is that I am incredibly competitive with the determination and heart of a Lion. The prize if I did would be a trip to Canada. I have never been West so for me this would be incredible.  This was three weeks ago.    Over the last three weeks I have frantically posted all sorts of stuff in an eager attempt to work out what works.   I have been called every name under the sun “Karma Whore” “Karma Farmer” “Aunt Susan” and to colloquially go back to Facebook.  I have even been requested to stay on my side of the “Pond”.   This is my confession.   This is why I have been behaving like Aunt Susan the Karma Farming Facebook fiend.   I apologise and if you’re interested I will of course keep you posted.

At times he seemed a bit cold and acted like he was annoyed with me for no apparent reason.  \n\n\nIt all came to a head when, three days ago when we were hanging out at my place, he asked me to hand him the TV remote. I was sitting right next to him on the couch and was working on my laptop.

I did not deserve to be treated this way. I told him our relationship was over and asked him to leave. He told me to calm down and stop overreacting. \n\nI simply walked to the front door opened it wide and told him to get out, and never come back. He walked out telling me I was being dramatic. \n\nThe very next day I returned the presents he had given me.

He would turn all the boys in class against me and bully me about my eyebrows. One time he begged me to buy him pizza and said he promises not to bully me all week if i do. So I bought him a box of pizza and he fulfilled his promise. I loved the idea. I began to do it on a regular basis. I started asking him every Friday what he wants next week so that the bullying doesn't happen again. He asked for 2 bags of hot fries (a potato chip flavor here in the US) and another time he wanted some milk from the cafeteria. And once he asked for colored pencils for art class. \n\nMy school had a uniform dress code. It was $25 per shirt and the pants were $15, if I remember correctly. He showed up the first day of 8th grade in regular clothes, a tee and jeans. So he got sent to the main office to wait for his parents. My aunt was there because she used to drop off my lunch and hand me money to buy food after school. She saw him upset and asked what's wrong and he starts crying lightly. His parents wouldn't come because they couldn't afford the uniform and decided it would be best to avoid the situation. After my aunt hands me my lunch, she buys him a uniform hoodie, a couple of tees, and a long sleeve. He said he had pants at home and he was hesitant to accept but eventually took them and thanked her. \n\nNow (13 years later) he runs a nonprofit that has something to do with kids receiving books.

In a very shy voice, she asked me if I can give her some of what ever I was cooking because she liked the smell. I think pregnant women sometimes have strong cravings and they can not resist it.\n\n Anyway, She was shy and apologized a lot for her request since we don’t know each other.

He's honestly the best brother I could have asked for. I still remember the day he was born and holding my newborn baby brother when I was a kid. As we grew up I always knew he was different but he's my brother and I love him and I wouldn't change him. He's honestly one of my best friends and having a brother with downs syndrome, especially one like him has made me a better person. \n\nLast month my parents went out of town for a few days and they asked if I'd stay with my brother and take care of the house. While he might have downs syndrome he's not entirely helpless he just can't really be on his own like that. So of course I agreed and brought my PS5 over and some games, snacks and beers, I called out of work for a few days and figured we'd have some fun just like when we were kids.\n\nWe were having a great time and were talking the first day while taking turns playing Elden Ring and my bro started the game and got to the part where the guy calls you \"maidenless\" and I said something like \"Ooooo he called you maidenless bro...daaaaaaamn.\" and my brother got super sad looking and I asked him what was wrong and he said, \"I am maidenless. I'll never have a girlfriend.\" So we talked about that for a bit and he was actually feeling super depressed because he's never had a girlfriend and didn't think he ever would.  We kind of talked it out and he was really sad and I decided fuck it we can find him a girl. \n\nI called a couple people I knew who were into that sort of thing to see if they knew anyone. Well one of my buddies had a number of this girl so I gave her a call. She was actually super sweet and understanding about the situation and she said she'd be glad to show my brother a good time for her usual rate. She had a cousin with downs so she was very sympathetic.\n\nI told my brother I'd pay a girl to come over and show him some fun on the condition that our parents will die without knowing I hired a prostitute to come to their house. He agreed.\n\nSo I made plans for her to come over, got my brother shaved and showered for his date. She showed up dressed up super nice she was also super hot. I'm no chef but I had picked up some food from Olive Garden for them. She was a genuinely nice person and was really good with him and I just left them to do their thing while I played the playstation in the livingroom. Eventually they passed by going upstairs to his room. I put my headphones on and kept playing. \n\nEventually they came back down and both had big smiles on their faces. She hung out with us a bit then it was time for her to go. I handed her the cash plus some extra as a bonus. She said my brother was a sweetheart and that I was a good brother to do something like that for him and that she had a good time. She handed me half the cash back.\n\nEventually my parents came back and thankfully are none the wiser as my mother especially would probably kill me. My brother is super appreciative and said it was the most fun he'd ever had. I have no regrets.",

We have two kids; a boy (5) and a girl (3).\n\nI get up every week day at 4:00am. Clean up the litter box, walk the dog, sweep up the house (no vacuum because everyone is still sleeping). I fold the clothes that had dried overnight in the dryer. I check the children’s laundry baskets, and start new loads.\n\nI go for a three miles run in the dark at 5:00am. I’m showered and on the road by 6:00am. I commute for an hour and a half to a job I’m not particularly thrilled about but I’m good at it and I’m paid well. I’d rather be home building furniture and learning to be a chef. \n\nOfficially I work from 8:00am to 5:00pm but we rarely finish at the office before 6:30pm. I drive home another hour and a half.\n\nWhen I get home the house is a mess. There’s no dinner. I’m starving. Did they eat? Yes they did. Uber Eats. Did they order anything for dad? Maybe, if I’m lucky. Wife will be on her phone. Daughter sometimes sleeping, sometimes not, son sometimes sleeping, sometimes not.\n\nI’d like to spend time with them, but I need to eat. Bowl of cereal or TV dinner, then.\n\nI check the laundry machine. Yep. Laundry from this morning is still there, and a huge pile that didn’t even get started is next to the machine. I put the first load into the dryer and start the next ones.\n\nWife lectures me on how stressful and hard her day was. How hard can it be when I hired a day nanny.\n\nOh she means stressful drama with her friends. Oh yes, tell me about what a bitch Brenda is and what a perfect mom she thinks she is and how she’s fake. My, that’s so interesting. \n\nYes, a blowjob would be awesome. Oh wait you didn’t say blowjob, you said bill, as in the bill for all the just had to have things you ordered off amazon today.\n\nShe tells me about how I never have time for any of them and how I’m an absentee father and I need to “step up” my contribution at home. Well, this weekend I have to mow the lawn and paint the garage and do all sorts of other chores you insist need to be done only by me, I’m sorry if there’s not two of me and I can’t go on play dates with you and go to champagne brunches where you all pat one another on the back and tell one another how brave and hard working you are to be sitting in a restaurant paying $50 for a plate of food at noon on a weekday for a three hour lunch and yoga afterward when your husband gets a Stouffer’s TV dinner that he heats himself.\n\nI’m sorry I can’t be like the J Crew family in the ad and be smiling all the time. Someone has to pay for the house you insisted on, the SUVs you insisted on, the Montessori school you insisted on, the fashionable clothes you insisted on, the organic this and that you insisted on, the hair salon and nail appointments you insisted on.\n\nThanks for calling me selfish for spending time on myself on my three mile runs. It’s the only thing for me I ever get to do, thanks, and it’s while you’re sleeping.\n\nI really wish you wouldn’t condescend to me when you discuss me to your friends, as if I’m obsessed with my career and that’s why you’re stuck being supermom. You already know I’m happy with an apartment and used economy cars and buying our clothes at Target and working a job where I get to be home to see my kids.\n\nWhy are you and the nanny so busy that your combined efforts can’t put the load of laundry in the dryer and press a button. Why do you leave dishes in the sink for me to do after I come home.\n\nIf you want me to keep working my 160k a year job to to fun your lifestyle that’s fine, I’m your hubby and that’s what I signed up for. I’m your man and it’s my job to support you.\n\nI wish you would act like you’re on my side, though, realize that I want to be home, but if you want all the stuff you insist are non negotiable, someone’’s got to go out there and pay for them because that shit ain’t free.\n\nThing is, all of it would be more okay if you just said thanks, Mike, I know you’re working hard or us and that you’re doing your part to keep this train rolling.\n\nInstead you paint this picture on social media like you’re busting your ass and I’m just off playing golf instead of stressing every second if I’m making enough money to support the lifestyle you want and feel entitled to.\n\nYou paint me like I’m into myself when I want to be into all of us, be part of the bubble you’re keeping me out of.\n\nWhy do you resent it so much when our son says he loves me and appreciates me and wants to spend time with me. Why do you hate it when our daughter wants to stay up and watch me eat and talk to me.\n\nI’m a husband and a father. I’m a workhorse. That’s life.\n\nI’ve told you how I feel but you tell me I’m crazy and being a crybaby. I don’t think asking you to order something for me if you’re going to spend money on dinner is unreasonable.\n\nIf you really want to impress me, cook something for all of us.\n\nMarriage is a partnership. It feels like I’m doing more of the lifting than half. That’s okay. But I need you to not gaslight me and treat me like I do nothing while you do everything. That’s not cool. \n\nI’m not your dad but I feel like I’ve just taken custody of you and our kids and just get treated like crap.\n\nPlease stop rolling y our eyes like it’s cringe when I try to play guitar and sing with our kids. They love it. You don’t have to but please don’t encourage them to laugh at me. \n\nThis is not a contest. This is marriage. I do my part, you do your part. Your part shouldn’t be laughing at my part, thanks.\n\nAlso, it’s hard to get a boner when you’re berating me. Be glad I can get it up at all when we make love.\n\nThanks.",

So I work at this one store, and I work on the sales floor; but before all that, I was just one person interviewing for a position at the store. Before I arrived for my interview, a friend of mine dared me to interview in a British accent. I said I’d do it only if they paid me, and to my surprise, they sent me like $10 through venmo (which was more than enough for me). I went into the interview with the mindset that I wasn’t gonna get hired and they inevitably hired me on the spot. Accent and all. I was nervous because I had already talked to a whole bunch of higher ups with the accent and decided to just go through with it -thinking it was only going to be a summer job. I was so wrong. It’s been like 7 months that I’ve been working there and I still use the accent to this day. When people ask me where I’m from I just tell them my hometown because I have several brits from that town whom I grew up with. The accent hasn’t really posed a problem until now cause my bf is friends with one of my coworkers so I’m gonna have to find the right time to come clean.. thanks for coming to my TedTalk \n\nEDIT1: I know that several of you guys wanted to know how I talk, so heres the link to hear me speak as both: a fraud, and as myself! Enjoy roasting me :-) https://vocaroo.com/i/s0UFHVF7Ljtu \n\nUPDATE: finally told my boyfriend about the accent and he said, and I quote, “well babe, you just gotta fake it till you make it, and get the hell out of there!” I got a lucky one, y’all! \n\nEDIT2: THANK YOU SO MUCH u/Technically-im-right FOR THE SILVER YOU BEAUTIFUL FOX, I <3 YOU AND YOUR COMMENT MADE ME BEAM FROM EAR TO EAR 💕",

We both got high but she got extremely paranoid because this was her first time taking it. I tried to keep her calm and make her feel safe but she thought I was going to kill her in the hotel room we were staying in. I told her we should go for a walk at the beach but she insisted that we stayed in the room. Finally I decided to leave the hotel to give her some space because I started to feel really uncomfortable and she ended up calling her mom saying I poisoned her and called the cops on me. The cops showed up and handcuffed me because of whatever my GF and her mom told the cops and almost had a gun pulled on me. The entire situation was a shit show. I ended up leaving the hotel, her mom & her sisters are driving from AZ to pick her up and I got a different hotel room closer to the airport. I thought about going home and ending this trip but instead I have decided to go to Hawaii by myself.

I think everyone’s sole purpose in life and the true meaning of life is to be happy, whatever that looks like for you as long as you’re not interfering with anyone else’s experience.

I wasn't drinking so I was going to be the one to drive us all over there but her best friend sent her boyfriend to pick us up. He wanted to show off his new mercedes and made the comment that the birthday girl should show up in a luxury car. I didn't like that but she was excited so I didn't say anything.\n\nMe and our two friends drove in my car behind them. I noticed right away that he was going well over the speed limit and when we would hit a stoplight he would rev his engine. We were driving and all of a sudden he sped up again, ran a red light, and was t-boned by an suv. I ran over to them as he was getting out of his side but her door was too damaged to open it,  I went over to the driver's side, and with the help of our friend we got her out. I lost her before paramedics could get there. I will never forget the feeling of her taking her last breath.\n\nThis girl was my absolute everything and I loved her so deeply. I truly believe she's my soulmate despite us being so young I couldn't and still can't picture myself with anyone but her. We had our whole future planned after college. I haven't been with anyone in any way since and have no intention to.\n\nI was blamed by her parents who i already had a strained relationship with and that resulted in them not allowing me to attend her funeral but I drive 3 hours to visit her grave every week sometimes twice a week. \n\nI’m not sure why I got the feeling to talk about it but I did.",

She admitted herself that morning for chest pains the night before. Was put through the gauntlet of tests that resulted in wildly high enzyme levels, so they placed her under 24hr observation. After spending the day, I needed to go home for the night with our daughter (6). In the wee hours, 3am, my wife rang the nurse to complain about the same pains that brought her in. An ecg was run and sent off, and in the moment, she was told that it was just anxiety. Given morphine to \"relax\". \n\nFF to 7am shift change and the new nurse introduces herself, my wife complains again. Another ecg run (no results given on the 3am test) and the results show she was in fact having a heart attack. Prepped for immediate surgery and after clearing a 100% frontal artery blockage with 3 stents, she is now in ICU recovery. AMA\n\nEtA: Thank you to (almost) everyone for all of the well wishes, great advice, inquisitiveness, and feeling of community when I needed it most.

Meet Remy: \n\nAlso, to the requests of wedding pictures:\n\n\nArticle I found of a crew member interview: \n\nhttps://barcielonda.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/working-on-a-quarantined-ship-an-interview/\n\nUpdate: this post has gotten huge! I’ll reply to everyone as I can, and will post more updates as they come.\n\n**Local time:**\n**2/7/2020**\n\n**08:08**\nWhat seems to be a military truck showed up on port? Will update here as I can. There are men in camo that are port side.\n\n**09:00**\nWe got fresh towels! To those on the ship, just call your attendant periodically. They are washing towels every now and again and can offer fresh ones.\n\n**09:41**\nInterviewed with a Japanese newspaper. There are now two military trucks and 5 ambulances, all in hazmat suits - imagining more people will be taken ashore for treatment. The food situation has gotten MUCH better - we went to bed hungry and thirsty, but are actually full now.\n\n**09:57**\n41 new cases for a total of 61 cases on board. Lots of news crews, helicopters, and ambulances arriving. No news has been shared from Princess Cruises - we learned from the news. The help desk told us that those who have tested negative will be notified as well.\n\n**10:28**\nThermometers and gloves will be delivered to every stateroom. Gloves and masks must be worn for open deck time. Temperature must be recorded at regular intervals - any temperature higher than 37.5c must be reported.\nThe cruise line is doing the very best that they can, and seem to have a system in place now that works.\n\n**15:29**\nJust woke up from a much needed nap - lunch came! Still 1-2 dozen ambulances out. Someone in our hallway was taken away. It feels a bit like the hunger games with uncertainty of who will be plucked next. Lunch is really nice today - much like the dining hall meals. Now our only issues are uncertainty and boredom, plus of course confinement and lack of exercise.\n\n**16:29**\nWorthy update.. I think booze is for sale?\n\n**16:58**\nWe found out some of our aussie friends were told that they were negative. Huge relief, as they sat next to us for the two weeks of the cruise at dinner!\n\n**18:05**\nJapanese authorities continue to take people off the boat, with about a dozen people to go, looks like. People are getting roughly an hours notice before being removed from the boat. Situation on the boat is good - we’re still stuck to the cabins but making the most of the situation. We’ve actually been busy today with everything online!\nWe’ve interviewed with a japanese newspaper and Chinese news site today, with an American news channel tonight/tomorrow. People have reached out to us to see if we can get supplies delivered. Y’all have been so kind and responsive, we really appreciate it!\n\n**18:30**\nWe learned that some people were separated from their husbands today due to being tested positive. Their spouses are not allowed to join them. Wonder if those spouses are being re-tested? Our status has yet to be confirmed.\n\n**18:51**\nDinner is here! Food situation remains to be great. When I catch up with replies, I’ll work on getting a photo album up.\n\n**19:35**\nRead on our Facebook thread that people are not being reimbursed by travel insurance due to the fact that it’s an epidemic.\nIn one case, a news journalist reached out to an insurer asking about why they weren’t covering us - turns out, they changed their mind and covered them! Hopefully either we can get coverage, OR the cruise line does the right thing for lost wages, lost time, uncertainty, and just in general the situation that none of us can control.\n\n\n**19:40**\n\n41 new cases with a total of 61. This concludes the 273 originally tested. Happy to say that my wife and I are NEGATIVE! \n\n**Nationality breakdown:**\nArgentina: 1\nAustralia: 5\nCanada: 5\nJapan: 21\nAmerican: 8\nBritain: 1\n\nQuarantine official end date is Wednesday, 2/19/2020, unless further developments are made by the Japanese health ministry. The US embassy is working to get us off the boat on this date.  Until then, cabin confinement will be a thing, along with visits to the open deck every day on a rotating schedule. Not everyone will get to go each day. Tomorrow, ocean view staterooms can go outside. All interior cabins have been able to see light today. Mandatory masks/gloves will be worn. \n\nThe Japanese health ministry has provided us with additional doctors and medical staff to assist with the ongoing situation.\n\nWe’ve been provided with even more water, and have two gallons stockpiled of bottled water. The cruise ship is well stocked, and passengers are being well taken care of. Cabin fever and keeping occupied is the major challenge for many of us, though puzzles are being handed out, origami paper, and many movies are being added. The cruise line has really come together to make the best of the situation. Broadband speeds have greatly increased, and are free. They’re also working on in-room activities to keep us occupied. A new food/beverage menu is being developed. They’ve addressed that being confined is a tough situation, and truly are making quality of life better.\n\nBalconies have been addressed - we can go out as we please, but are required to wear masks.\n\nThe crew has done an amazing job through extraordinary circumstances, and Princess Cruises has really stepped to the plate today. The captain has been much more vocal today - I can’t imagine the stress that’s being put on him between the company, embassies, the Japanese government, and passengers frustrations. \n\nTomorrow morning at about 08:00, the Diamond Princess will set sail to sea for normal marine operations (I.e, making water), and will return in the evening back to Yokohama’s daikoku cruise terminal. \n\nI’ll have more updates tomorrow - off to watch a movie with the wife! Things are good, and today, we had BACON. Our clogged arteries are happy! Next adventure starts tomorrow.\n\n\n**2/8/2020**\n**07:13**\nReplied to many comments/Facebook, about to interview with channel 5 in DFW. There are a couple ambulances out but from our understanding everyone was taken off who was positive last night.\n\n**08:21**\nFirst person has been taken off the ship. Just finished interviewing with Chanel 5 in DFW - will be on at 22:00 central standard time.\n\n**08:44**\nNoticed a few suitcases and people that look like they’re boarding - I’m thinking that these were the Japanese medical professionals that they were talking about.\n\n**08:55**\nThe president of Princess Cruises is here in japan working to make sure the cruise remains comfortable for its passengers. A few passengers reported fevers and are being checked by medical staff - that’s what the ambulances are for. \nA consoling hotline has been opened for guests aboard the cruise. \nWe will shortly set sail to perform essential marine activities off the coast of japan. We will arrive back to Yokohama on 2/9/2020, 0900. They are warning for rough seas such as the other night. Breakfast has just arrived! Looking good food wise again.\n\nIn other news, we talked to some crew and asked how they were doing. They stated that they are hanging in there, but not sleeping too well due to the increased workload. It’s going to be a long two weeks for them - they’re working incredibly hard!\n\n**09:26**\n\nThe princess diamond just tooted it’s horn and is now off to sea!\n\n**11:31**\nDeck 8 even room numbers with an ocean view window can go to the open deck now for a bit.\n\n**13:48**\nConfirmed: 2 additional coronavirus cases, total is now 63. One Chinese citizen, and one US citizen. 28 medical staff were let on board (16 doctors, 12, nurses), and clerks. \nNegotiations are being made to get laundry done as well as staterooms cleaned by attendants for the first time in nearly a week. \nThere is a designated smoking area being negotiated for specific times for people to smoke. Nicotine gum is also available. \nThe Captain is thankful for our cooperation, and quarantine officials are happy with how we are handling procedures. \nEntertainment services: movies are continuously being uploaded. \nEducation on coronavirus is also posted on our stateroom TV. \nMedications will be handed out to passengers throughout the day.\n\n**14:30**\nMore people allowed onto the decks from the 10th floor balconies, separated on the 7th floor open deck &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; the 15th floor.\n\n**15:40**\nJust interviewed with NHK and will be on at 19:00 local time in tokyo - it will be broadcasted through japan and internationally. \nWe get to go outside for the first time in 20 minutes!\n\n**16:43**\nWe’ll be meeting with the Japanese coast guard at around 18:30 for samples to be taken off the ship, and more medication to be delivered. We are approx. 15 nautical miles away from land. Logistics of sorting so much medication is difficult, but the most critical of medications are being delivered first. Emergency medication is available if needed. \n\nPeople who now have fevers/coughs are being watched are not allowed to be on the open decks.\n\nIt looks like it’s approved for some guests services to be resumed on a rotation basis - a plan is being made for laundry, and stateroom cleaning (thank god.. that toilet needs some help).\n\nDetergents will be delivered for hand washing clothes as well. \n\nWe just were able to be outside from 1600-1700. It was amazing to be outside for the first time in six days! \nThings are really looking up!\n\n**Around 20:00**\nA reminder was made by the captain that there is counseling support available via phone in English, Japanese, and other languages.\nJapanese coast guard operation underway - medication is being delivered via helicopter to the coast guard boats, then delivered using said boats. Samples are being offloaded.\nBandwidth continues to be upgraded, though is choppy at sea. \nOngoing communication with the US embassy japan is being made, and the procedures we are following mirrors that required of the Japanese government. \nThe US CDC advises that we are following the safest protocol to prevent viral infections on cruise ships (passengers remaining in staterooms. \nEmbassies and governments from other countries are also in contact. \nTomorrow morning, balcony staterooms will finish going outside before interior staterooms start over again on rotation.\n\n\n**2/9/2020**\n\n**08:28**\nWe just got breakfast.. was really hoping for breakfast to be the best meal of the day due to the last two days being pretty decent. Today we’re back to pastries and two boiled eggs. Yikes.\nAlso, now docking to daikoku pier in Yokahama, japan. I count 8 ambulances lined up - either on standby or here for new cases?\n\n**08:43**\nLooks like supplies are here. In the process of docking. Very busy on the ground. Japanese authorities requesting people to not feed the birds croissants. \n\n**09:23**\nNot looking good out there.\n14 ambulances, hazmat suits and all. No news has been given as of yet. LOTS of supplies being loaded.\n\n**09:42**\nMedication delivery is a logistical nightmare due to the volume of medications - in one case, a man has been out of anti-hypertensives for six days and is starting to worry d/t chest discomfort.\nThere are now 15 ambulances outside.\nSupposedly, Princess was charging 18% gratuity for room service, but after being mentioned on Twitter all costs were dropped. There are no longer room service fees.\nWe’ve heard from a friend on the westerdam cruise from holland America that isn’t being allowed to dock. No talk of compensation for lost wages, etc. have been made from Princess, but holland America has issued a 100% refund with a 50% discount on a future cruise. We are hoping that princess will do the same. We didn’t save for the trip expecting a lengthy quarantine.\n\n**11:47**\nVerification of sights outside our room. \n\n\n**12:17**\nSomeone is being loaded into an ambulance, with two lined up behind it it appears. One is pulled up to the ship with a blue tarp over the back.\n\n**12:36**\nAnnouncement from the captain: several guests are ill, but not related to coronavirus. They will be taken off the ship today. Medications are still being dispensed. Hopefully these I’ll passengers were not related to lack of medication! \nLaundry services approved, and will be offered on a deck to deck basis. More information to follow when available. \nNo new news from the health ministry of japan.\n\n**13:00**\nFood situation is pretty hard to get down due to taste (not really sure why it’s downgraded quite so much being that 2/7 was so awesome), but they’re loading it up with rice to fill people. Many people who are afraid of the virus aren’t wanting to eat. We’re doing fine - just continuing to look at the bright side of things!\n\n**14:32**\n6 people diagnosed with coronavirus, bringing the total to 69. They are being offloaded along with (correction - 9 people) that have other medical conditions for a total of 15 getting off today. All of these people will be quarantined.\n\n**15:35**\nNo new activity other than more allowed out to the open decks, BUT this couple got wine delivered by a drone! Hilarious!\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7981025/Gold-Coast-couple-quarantined-Diamond-Princess-Cruise-Ship-wine-delivered-drone.html\n\n**15:50**\nMail from the US embassy: to sum, at the end of these 14 days we will be able to leave the boat unrestricted. \nA field pharmacy with 7 pharmacists is active aboard, and over half of all medication requests will be delivered to guests today.\nPer CDC, my wife is getting the chuckles with the following rules.. “wear a face mask and keep a distance of 6 feet away from your cabin mate, if you have one.”\n\n**18:58**\nCaptain update: a Letter from the president of Princess Cruises will be issued regarding refunds and compensation tonight, as well as laundry powder.\nLaundry services now available on a rotating basis for small loads.\nLooks like tomorrow we will be able to get out again due to an updated schedule - we’re really excited to go again! Today has been a good day. \nDinner also arrived - not bad, it was tasty! Never going to have rice in my life again though after this quarantine. Send thoughts to stateroom attendants, though. Some of them are getting as little as 3 hours of sleep in this situation. \nDay five, complete!\n\n**21:47**\nUpdate before I forget on the ventilation system.. CDC said in a letter sent to us that the ventilation system isn’t a concern in spreading the virus, as there is not really any evidence to show that it’s an issue. \nOff to bed for us, will continue to update in the morning! Thank you all for the support.\n\n**22:22**\nHUGE UPDATE!\n100% refund for all cruise guests and a 100% future cruise credit equal to the price that we paid for this cruise if used before 2/28/2021. All reasonable charges dropped from our onboard folio, and no further costs will be incurred during the quarantine period. All pre/post hotels, transfers, pre-paid excursions, taxes/port, and princess airline travel will be fully refunded. \nArrangements will be made for travel home for guests. We already have a delta flight pre-booked that we’ve had moved around.\nThank you so much Princess for doing the right thing - this makes being out of work and being stuck away from home much easier for the lot of us! Thank you to the crew for working extra hard to keep us safe.\n\n**2/10/2020**\n\n**06:30**\nJust woke up - got in touch with family/friends. \nOutside, we see only two ambulances and a van. WFAA interview rescheduled due to breaking news in Dallas - new time will be tomorrow. No new news as of yet.\n\n**07:15**\nA few cars showed up behind the ambulances - nothing too exciting.\n\n**07:35**\nBreakfast is here! Scrambled egg sandwich, a muffin, a pastry, grapes, an orange, yogurt, and two cookies. Cookies for breakfast? I’m in! 😂\n“A chocolate chip cookie for breakfast? I am so happy! That’s legit!”- the wife\n\n**08:31**\n6 ambulances w/ some cars are parked outside. No ambulances are pulled up to the boat, so looks like as of now we’re in the clear!

She says she’s doing okay.\n\n**09:54**\nA motor coach just pulled up and parked next to the 6 ambulances. Not really sure what the motor coach is here for? Some military vehicles are here as well.\nAbout to do a sound check with the mark davis show.\n\n**12:30**\nThey just delivered N95 masks, we’re excited to finally be protected! \nIn other news, medications continue to be dispensed, but some people on our Facebook page are taking their medications every other day, some running out of Parkinson’s medication, etc. Rough situation, really hope the logistics are worked out and it’s resolved! There are additional pharmacists onboard now.\n\n**12:44**\nCaptain announcement: extended break till 1400 for deck time in order to not interrupt lunch.\nSome complaints have been made about announcements being too frequent, but we actually think this is perfect - the captain read a comment from a guest - he says\n“Knowing is better than guessing, and not knowing.” They’re working on having fewer announcements by possibly putting the deck times on a paper delivered to our room. \nI’d like to thank you all for being so supportive of my wife and I!\n\n**13:06**\nUpdate that many of you have been asking about: the world health organization has clarified that the end date of quarantine is 2/19. For those closely in contact with newly infected people (for example, roommates of a newly infected person), the quarantine is extended to 14 days from the date of last contact with the infected individuals.\n\n**13:40**\nFood came! Salmon, pasta salad, a roll, and some sort of desert (I’m not actually sure what it was). We’re settling down for a movie now while waiting for our outside time that is coming!\n\n**14:40**\nRumor has it that there are 60 new cases. We haven’t been given any information as of yet, and I can’t find any news on it yet. HOWEVER this is what we see outside. \nPeople are beginning to put on full protection suits - looking like more are likely to be taken off. At this point, we’re kind of just wishing that all passengers would be tested. Again, we have no confirmation as of yet on the new cases.\n\n**14:43**\nmore ambulances arriving, sirens on.\n\n**14:45**\nFire trucks and ambulances have pulled up to the ship where passengers have been offloaded the past few days. \nPS fire trucks/water rescue are normal in these kinds of operations in japan.\n\n**14:51**\nA news helicopter is on scene with news crews pulled up to the side. Here’s a picture of what seems to be the Japanese military building a tunnel (presumably for passenger offloading) and an ambulance pulling up for pickup.\n\n**15:05**\nThe captain has made an announcement. He recognizes that there is lots of activity on the ground. He is waiting for the Japanese health ministry to send an official communication to the cruise line in order to provide accurate information. Meanwhile, it’s almost our turn to go outside. Honestly, we’re considering skipping our outside time to stay safe, but are pretty desperate to stretch our legs.\n\n**15:09**\nThe first ambulance has pulled away, and another is pulling up. Spoke with a neighbor a few balconies across from me - he says he’s not going out on the open decks in fear of getting the virus and extending his quarantine.\n\n**15:17**\nA view of what’s going on now.\n\n\n**15:57**\nConfirmed by captain: 66 new cases of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess. There were 69 total yesterday, bringing the total to 135 today. This was to be expected this early in the quarantine period, as many of these individuals were exposed prior to the quarantine start.\n\n**16:30**\nJust got inside from our time on the open deck. Here are some inside views.\n\n\n**18:29**\nCaptain announcement.\nCoronavirus cases reduced from 66 to 65, 5 of which are crew members. Total count reduced from 135 to 134.\nInterior staterooms will get priority for natural sunlight - balconies time will be reduced, however they will still be able to go out onto the open deck from time to time. \nThe captain stated that he noticed some people on the balcony stretching and getting a workout, then teased and said “I have to say.. the port side did better.”\nMail services now in place, and instructions will be delivered to our rooms. \nHe addressed the ventilation system - air is filtered &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; 100% fresh air is being delivered to our staterooms. No reason to worry about the virus being spread through rooms. He thanked and praised everyone on board for their extraordinary patience and support.\n\n**18:36**\nDinner is here! My wife got pasta and marinara, I got some sort of shrimp on rice. I repeat - when we get home, we’re never having rice again. 😳\nWe got some lemon bars too! \n\n**19:04**\nEmbassy email - confirms that princess/carnival clean their air through and through, and there is no risk to passengers. They provided this video for all Americans aboard.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zmAXT-AIyjs\n\n**21:56**\nMedication has arrived for us, hopefully meaning that most of the ship has received theirs.\n\n**23:30**\nWe’ve finished our radio interviews with Mark Davis &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; WBAP, and winding down for bed. Tomorrow morning we interview with a news station (WFAA), then set your sea for the day to preform vital marine operations (dumping waste, making water). \nThank you all again for the support, and I will update in the morning! \n\nSpecial shoutout to u/CausticSaint - we got a care package delivered to our room from he and his wife. \n\nWords can’t begin to express how thankful we are. WE HAVE TOOTHPASTE!\n\n**2/11/2020**\n**06:30**\nWoke up to get ready for our interview from a DFW news source, WFAA. Shortly after, NBC. \nNo new news as of yet, but we opened the window to find quite a few ambulances! Here’s the view: \n\n**08:00**\nWe got breakfast! It came in the middle of one of our interviews, but we got small egg sandwich, one croissant, and a muffin. No fruit or yogurt today. We’re all wondering where the menu is for today - last time we didn’t get a menu was at the start of the quarantine. It’s not just us - the people around us haven’t received a menu either. The help desk is checking with meal services. WFAA will be aired at 10pm central time.\n\n**08:26**\nCurrent look outside - many more ambulances, people are being taken off the boat now. Nothing confirmed as of yet.\n\n**08:46**\nLooks like we’re fueling up today. \n\n**09:00**\nThe sound of sirens is in the air today! Probably about 5-6 going off at once. Truly feels like we’re in a apocalyptic movie at this point with now 32 ambulances parked outside. There are military vehicles with a big Red Cross on them as well - assuming military medical staff.\n\n**9:21**\nCaptain states a good morning, and states that we’re ready to face a day of challenges strong and united.\nHe says updates will be given as available.\nThe diamond princess will set sail around 1200, give or take a few hours depending on timing of complications on the ground (loading supplies,, disembarking guests and crew).\nWe will be headed southeast out to sea to make water and dump waste. We will turn around after that to return to daikoku pier.\nWind speeds around 55km/hr when out to sea, and the waters shouldn’t be quite as bad this time.\nThey’ve plotted the best possible course to minimize rocking. \nHe reminded us to check our temperature/wear masks, and joked that we are all experts by now. He also reminded us to remain hydrated - we now have quite a bit of water. \nEvery guest has had a chance to send in laundry now. The laundry that my wife and I sent last night should arrive soon. \nA rotation from deck to deck has been made.\nHe concluded with “let’s tackle this day together.”\n\n**11:48**\nTook a short nap - we were tired from the day before, and the wife had a bit of a headache. Up now - they’re handing out vitamin C tablet bottles to interior staterooms to prevent deficiency.. don’t want anyone getting scurvy! Again, they’re getting priority over natural light so they don’t develop a vitamin D deficiency. \n\n**12:00**\nCaptain announcement: the ambulances outside aren’t for new cases. They weren’t done offloading passengers from the previous day. 32 out of 65 have been taken off so far. They are prioritizing disembarkation of guests/crew based on acuity. \nA small percentage of waste is being taken off by the trucks we thought were fuel trucks currently, giving us more time to stay in port. Our new time of departure is 1700-1800. \nIT system managers have gotten in contact regarding internet - Princesses goal is to provide the best internet at sea, but being as we’ve had such high traffic these last few days, internet disruptions have occurred. We were wondering about that! They are aware of the issue, and working on fixing it.\nMedications are nearly finished being dispensed. Any urgent medication is available if needed. \nThe crew continues to receive high praise over social media/letters, and are keeping spirits high. The crew are grateful of the huge support.\n\n**12:45**\nLunch has arrived! I think Reddit worked - NO RICE! 😍 And it’s really good! Tomorrow’s selections look great too. Princess continues to step up their game to handle this situation. \nHere’s the food that arrived. I’ll post some pics of food during the first few days of quarantine in a bit.\n\n\n**14:00**\n\nThere is a bus being loaded with people who are disembarking. \n\n\nPS: Just to clarify on the WFAA interview.. we don’t think the conditions are brutal as stated by news reporters. We think Princess Cruises are doing an amazing job handling the situation, and doing their very best. Food is much better today, we have enough time on our balcony to get fresh air, and have plenty to keep us entertained. People in interior rooms are being given vitamin C, and have priority over open deck time for natural light. Ready for more space to stretch our legs, but we’re doing just fine!\nWe think our interview may have been short due to poor connection. \nNBC on the other hand did a great job portraying how we’re doing!\n\n**16:13**\nCaptain announcement - all 65 coronavirus positive passengers are now disembarked. Several more of our fellow cruisers were taken to local hospitals for shoreside care unrelated to the coronavirus. We’re worried that this may have been related to medication. \nThe Japanese health ministry has provided us with 45 doctors, 55 nurses, and 45 pharmacists, most of which are volunteers. What a huge service! \nHe reassured that the ventilation system is adequate for control of the virus.\nThe internet continues to be upgraded/fixed, and will be up shortly. \n\nApparently there was a power ranger in a boat entertaining people toddy while they were out on the open decks. People really were enjoying him until the police shoo’d him away.\n\nPS to Japanese readers, happy Founders Day!\n\n**18:25**\nWe are completely finished offloading all guests who needed to be hospitalized. We are just about to set sail in a southeasterly direction to preform essential marine operations. According to the Japanese ministry of health, 1850 guests requested medication - all of these requests have been filled. Some medication was unable to be delivered due to brands not being available in Japan - generics are being hunted down.\n8 days to go!\nDinner is here, here it is! Looks are deceiving. We knew it would be a rough night, but we ended up just heating up some instant noodles that we had. I gave my wife my beef. This is the first time that I’ve seen my wife get visibly upset over food and miss good food. Usually I’m the foodie!\n\n**20:53**\nThe Japanese coast guard boats are joining us tonight for if in the case we need assistance. Well underway to sea, and hardly can see land lights at this point. We will get back into Tokyo Bay and to daikoku pier, Yokohama at around 0900. \nIt’s been a long day for us - we’re throwing in the towel early tonight. More updates to come in the morning - good night!\n\n**2/12/2020**\n**7:00**\nGood morning everyone! Woke up and still at sea - looks like we have just two more hours before docking. We were contacted by a lot of people this morning. We’ll interview with CBC, WNBC, and world news radio over the next day or so. \n\n**8:00**\nBreakfast is here! It’s awesome again today! Sausage links, eggs, bacon, muffins, yogurt, fruit - everything! Couldn’t ask for better. It’s going to be a good day! \n\n\n**8:30**\nWe’ve passed through Tokyo bay and are getting ready to dock at daikoku pier again. Not too many ambulances out, just a few waste trucks.\n\nShoutout to the chick fil a on north belt line road, Irving Texas! The owner contacted me and offered a wedding gift + is providing a few meal nights for a bible study for adults with special needs that my wife and I volunteer at. How cool is that! \n\n**8:50**\nDocked! Unfortunately, they’ve turned the boat around today, so no views of the ground. Not sure how much news of the ground we’ll have - it’ll mainly be announcements. We can see Mt. Fuji from this side though!\n\n\n**9:37**\nThe captain announced that the Japanese health ministry has confirmed 38 additional cases of coronavirus aboard, and they will be notified shortly. These guests will be disembarked today.\nWe now have more bandwidth than any boat in the sea, with the most people connected on any given vessel, ever. He states that we are pushing the limits of technology. Teams all over the world are workingWe also got our laundry back! \nAround 5AM there was a fire threat alarm that woke us up - it was broadcasted outside of our room, though woke some of us up. Turns out there was a battery malfunction in an electoral locker that caused some smoke. The situation is now under control now, and relatively normal.\n\n**10:00**\nSomeone on our Facebook group mentioned that they’ve heard someone loudly crying for two hours in the room next to them. Someone commented, confessing that it may have been them due to having kidney stones the last 24 hours. The awful thing is that she’s afraid to leave the boat for medical treatment, because she’s afraid that her quarantine would start over if she left. Good thing we picked up extra medical staff!\n\n**10:15**\nNew N95 masks were delivered! That’s good - the masks we had before we getting kind of.. used! The US embassy emailed us and reassured us that everything is the same as of now. \nJapanese flags are flying out of a lot of balconies, and it’s a clear day. There’s an awesome view of Mt. Fuji!\n\n**11:00**\nA boat pulled up next to us and waved. They are holding up a sign with a phone number. \n\n**12:30**\nCaptain announcement: no new updates on the coronavirus, however, some of our stations are having issues broadcasting due to local interference, but everything else is working great.  \n\nPS Here’s lunch! I had a bowl of noodles with it. I gave most of mine to my wife - she loves mashed potatoes, and I wasn’t too crazy about it. Everything has a weird taste on this one, two meatballs well done, one rare. Had some leftover breakfast that did the job! Cracked open a coke to finish the job. The wife and I aren’t big soda drinkers, but they sure hit the spot! Now to watch chopped jr. \n\n\n**13:00**\nWe’ve worked with the Japanese government + others to help us preform essential marine operations. Here’s a boat leaving our ship going out to sea, presumably. Notice at the front of the boat the people in full protective gear. \n\n\n**14:00**\nLooks like our friends across the hall in an interior room are getting out again today. Interior rooms are getting out about every day for an hour now - this is great! We received an update from the captain via paper saying that an outside time schedule will be delivered soon that way announcements wouldn’t interrupt us so much. Any time an announcement is made, it is repeated shortly after in Japanese.\n\n**15:00**\n\nNo big updates. We have another ship next to us helping as previously mentioned. With the balcony facing the sun, it’s getting pretty warm in the room! Views are still pretty, though we can’t see Fuji anymore.\n\n**16:50**\nCaptain confirmed *39* cases, with a total of *173* now. There was one officially added. Internet/streaming remains a little iffy, but is improving throughout the day.\n\n**17:00**\nLast group of the day has gone out to the open decks. Not much new today, but it looks like we get to go out first thing in the morning - we’re next! \n\n**18:47**\nWe got another email from the embassy. There are 32 total American passengers that contracted the virus, all of which are getting excellent care according to the consular staff of the embassy. Of all confirmed cases in japan, 9 have recovered thus far.\n\n**19:00**\nCaptain announcement: \nThere are 26 patients that got offloaded today. \nThe captain reiterated that the ventilation is good -  the CDC isn’t worried due to lack of evidence supporting spread of the virus from room to room. \nHe called today “not the best of days” due to the choppy internet, but teams across the globe continue to work hard on it. \nHe thanked us all for the faith we have in the crew, and mentioned that soon we we will be back to everyday lives.\n\n\n**19:45**\nApparently people over 75 are randomly being tested. We are wondering if they will test us all - some people aren’t following guidelines, and on open deck time no one seems to enforce the rules. Some people are maskless. If someone contracts the virus let’s say today, it could potentially not show up until 14 days from now. The implications of this could be devastating regarding the spread of the virus!\nDinner! Breakfast definitely won today. Here’s a pic! \n\n\n**23:54**\nLate night today - just finished interviewing with CNBC. Possible interview with a documentary producer tomorrow. \nWe’ve noticed a trend in the media contacting our  parents, so that’s not so fun - not sure how the contact numbers are getting to them.\nGoing to head to bed for the night - thank you all for your support!\n\n**2/13/2020**\n**00:28**\n\nCheck this out! Letter to all Diamond Princess crew regarding the quarantine. They will get two months of PTO! Here’s the letter. \n\n“We are deeply grateful and incredibly proud of all of you. We understand that each of you are under great stress in this extraordinary situation, and we hope you are taking some time to speak with your family and friends - as well as reaching out to our Crew Assistance resources.\n\nWe have been working to determine how we can best support you once we are past this difficult time. You deserve, and will need, a break. So, we offer you two months of paid time off. This will include your salary and any average gratuities you may normally receive.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use the paid time off for much needed rest. If you decide to leave when the quarantine and later choose to rejoin a ship before the two months pass, you will still receive this extra pay.\n\nIn addition, all reasonable charges to your onboard account for this voyage will be cleared. You will not incur any other charges during the quarantine period.\n\nWe will also handle your flights to return home and your job will be protected to return for another contract.\n\nWe learn more information every day, and we appreciate your patience as we do our best to keep you informed. Your colleagues across the fleet and all of us ashore send you our ongoing support and thanks.” -jan, CEO of Princess Cruises\n\n**08:00**\nWoke up to orange juice, a banana, banana muffin, yogurt, eggs, a croissant. and sausage. Good breakfast again! Looks a bit stormy today - I’m guessing it will rain for the first time since being in port. Here are some pics of dinner/outside.\n\n\n**09:02**\nDefinitely raining. Our outside time is around 9:30 - good thing we bought umbrellas in Hong Kong! No new news as of yet.\n\n**9:15**\nCaptain announcement: we’re now we’ll into the second week of our quarantine. He thanks of for our patience. He provided sympathies to those that are ill, their family, and friends. \nHe shared guidance from health authorities - further cases were expected after quarantine began due to pre-quarantine exposure. He reinforced all regulations/procedures, and said that we are all in this together. \nMasks must be worn any time an external door is opened. \nHe acknowledged that sometimes media is reporting before him, but the captain is working with authorities to provide *accurate* information as soon as possible. \nAccuracy and full transparency with us/crew are his top priority. \nProtocols are still being reviewed by the ministry of health to clean staterooms, as they haven’t been cleaned since 2/3. Linens and towels are still available upon request. \nDietary surveys have been passed out, and must be completed by 1pm. \nInternet has intermittent breaks only due to the rotation of satellites.\nHe says that we are all in this together, and everything is being done to support one another. \n\n**9:30**\nSlight change in plans - all passengers will go to the 7th deck rather than split between the 7th and 15th today due to rain. We will be on the starboard side. \nIn other news, I got a call today that my great grandmother is now in hospice. She fell and broke her hip about a week ago, survived surgery, but is having trouble with rehab. Hoping to get off this boat to see her! She’s 97. \n\n**9:40**\nSeems to be a miscommunication between the bridge and staff - all guests were moved to the port side during this trip outside. \n\n**10:30**\nJust got back from outside - got to visit the port side of the 7th deck today. Very good view of whys going on down below, some of the best pics yet! We got some good walks in, and I tried to have a run. I had to stop pretty soon only because N95 masks were definitely not made to run with! They make it fairly hard to breathe faster than you would normally, making it feel like you can’t catch a breath of fresh air. Can’t wait until we can actually go outside and get a full lung of normal air! \n\n**Part 2!** \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/f3hcea/part_2_im_a_us_citizen_aboard_the_diamond/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

        "input": "I suffered a mild stroke while masturbating and had to call 911. First responders and several family members saw my \"setup\" and I'm still struggling with how to deal with the embarrassment of it all. AMA UPDATE: In the past 24 hours, my life got way more embarrassing, and then got way better.  I seriously expected to get like 3 comments to this post.   As in 1) that's gay, 2) sucks to be you and 3) \"stroke\" jokes.   I was starting to get concerned yesterday afternoon when this thing really started to get upvoted and all my detailed answers were already in the comments.   Perhaps I should have expected this, but a link to this post made it into my parents email inbox via a friend of my younger sister (not the \"freaky one) who was like \"hey, isn't this what happened to your brother.\"   I just assumed it was going to stay in the family, but why would I think that.   Happy to elaborate if needed, but long story short, the parents got the link because my sister was \"concerned\" for me and thought this would help.  I wanted to kill her initially.  The parents read all the comments. (Hi, Mom)  They didn't know Reddit existed and were really impressed with the \"quality\" of the discussion and were happy they got to hear my unfiltered perspective on all this.   You guys were totally right.  They made comments respecting my private sex life and were embarrassed *for* me not judgemental *of* me.  It was a long discussion (\\~3 hours) that ended with lots of joking, laughing and some crying.   At one point, my Dad even asked \"so, that feels good, huh.\"  I think he's curious :)  And my sister maintains she did not take my butt plug.  \n\n\nOver a month ago, I had a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) and have basically made a full recovery.   But I literally thought I was going to die.   I had settled in for an extended session of self love complete with several toys and porn airplaying to the TV.   About 20 minutes in, my entire left side (I'm left handed) went numb and I lost strength in BOTH arms.  I felt I could not lift them above my shoulders.  And nothing made sense.   The girl in the video had been talking dirty, but now sounded like garbled nonsense.   I tried to talk, like to say \"What the fuck\" out loud or something and all that came out was \"uuufffdddggh\", so at that point, I lost all sense of the situation and just dialed 911.  Within what seemed like 3.5 seconds, first responders knocked at my door and I greeted them without any clothes on, porn still playing, big dildos and more glistening on a towel on the floor.   I was making no sense and was no doubt acting really out of it, so they took me to the ER where I was discharged a few hours later with the full clarity of what had happened.  My dad was at the ER with me and when he said \"let's get you home\" all I was thinking is that I needed to get into the house first.  My mother and sister's car were parked out front of my house when we pulled up, so this was clearly moot.   I am just a bit mortified.

For the past 3 months it's been a very well known plan that when I (30f) went in to labor, my husband was going to drive me to the hospital and my MIL was going to pick up my mother, my kids and my grandmother (all from one house). BOTH my MIL and my mom were supposed to be in the delivery room. My gram was to watch my two kids in the waiting room. Everyone was in agreement with the plan. Now, my husband and I have 2 sons already and for both births, my mother was present. She helped me through so much of the mental anguish and panic, especially after my last- whom literally almost killed me. I was bleeding out on the table and my mom was the only one able to keep me calm. I needed her to be with me with this baby too; mentally. So we worked this plan out months in advance and everyone was on the same page. \n\nHowever, I go in to labor.. we make the phone calls to MIL and my mom. Telling my mom to be ready and my MIL to go get my mother. An hour and 15 minutes later, MIL shows up at the hospital without my mom, my kids or my grandmother. She said \"well it's late so we need to just let everyone sleep\" (it was 9:30pm) and then sat her ass down on the chair in the delivery room and jumped on her phone. I told her in a pissed off tone to go get my mom, that was the plan, I needed my mom, etc etc and she just wouldn't. At one point saying that she didn't feel up to driving that much (my mom lives 20 minutes from her house, an hour away). So, I told her to get the fuck out of the room and that she was dead to me. The amount of resentment and disgust that I felt toward her in this moment  is honestly not something I feel I will overcome any time soon. She was pissed, saying that my mom got to experience 2 births already and how she didn't do anything wrong and she was \"just being respectful of people's sleep\" and where she wasn't leaving, she was actually escorted out. \n\nNow, my mom was able to make it to the hospital literally just as I was giving birth. My kids and my grandmother weren't able to make it, which bothers me a great deal (we promised our kids they would be the first to meet their sister, outside of us and grammie).

They convinced her that she was starting to look old and that I would find someone else to be with if she did not do something. That was why her mom gave her the money for the operations. \n\nHer mom and sister look like Bruce Campbell in Escape From LA. They are the very last people on the planet that should be telling anyone to get plastic surgery. I used some of the comments I read on my post as talking points. I told her that I loved her and that she was the person that I wanted to spend my life with. I told her that the surgery would take a while longer to settle down and that as I got more used to her new face I would learn to appreciate it. \n\nShe asked me if I wanted her to see if she could get it reversed. I almost screamed at her. The last thing in the world I want is for her to fuck up her face more than it already is. I asked her if she could please just leave it and let me get used to it. \n\nWe talked for about three hours and we decided that her mom and sister would not be a part of any decisions in our life going forward. She is going to leave her face alone and give me a chance to get used to it. We are going to look for a marriage counselor and maybe individual counselors for each of us. I am going to make an effort to show her every day how I still find her desirable and she is going to make an effort to believe me when I tell her I love her the way she is. \n\nWe are going to talk to her mom and sister and tell them that we are taking a break from them. We are going to block them and get our shit together before we allow them back into our lives. \n\nThank you to everyone who tried to help me. \n\nI would like to add that I did not think there were that many guys out there with a weird blue squid lady fetish.

But then he said “I should’ve expected this because you have 3 sisters”\n\nI explained that me having 3 sisters have nothing to do with the gender of our child.

I told that doesn’t make any since because it should be the same for him then. He said no because both of their wives have more brothers than sisters.\n\nHe was getting frustrated but I was just laughing at him.

My friend Sandra and I have known each other for over 20 years (we are 30-32). Sandra is getting married to Andres, and I am married to Ian.\n\nSome relevant information:\n\n- Andres and I originally come from the same country and even the same region. We share many characteristics.\n- We both have very round faces, deep brown eyes, long straight black hair, etc. If you didn't know better, you might assume we are siblings.\n- I met Andres six years ago and introduced him to Sandra. He proposed two years ago.\n- I own a beautiful property in my home country that I was ready to lend to Sandra and Andres for their wedding.\n- My property is like a finca and has 10 rooms. Usually, I would rent it out for weddings at a somewhat high price, but I was happy to give it to them at no cost, with the condition that they hire their own catering and have their guests strip their beds when they leave.\n\nThe issue:\n\nThree months ago, Sandra became more reclusive. She wouldn't answer my texts, and we didn't meet up. Two weeks ago, she appeared at my door with Andres. They sat us down (my husband included) and said she suspected that my daughter is actually Andres' biological daughter and requested a paternity test for peace of mind.\n\nI was so shocked that I couldn't say anything. My husband lost his temper and raised his voice, telling Sandra that she was being absolutely stupid.\n\nSandra pointed out that my daughter looks like Andres. I explained that Andres and I look alike. She kept shaking her head, saying my daughter would look more like my husband and not like my exact copy.\n\nThe evening ended poorly. I agreed to the test if they paid for it. The results came back last Friday, showing that Andres was not the father. We also did a test confirming that my husband is the father.\n\nSandra cried and tried to hug me. I told her I didn't want to and that I didn't want to be friends with her for the time being. She kept saying her worries were justified and made a comment about \"women from your country being more likely to do that.\"\n\nIn that moment, I was filled with anger. I told her she could forget about using the venue and that I didn't want her in my life anymore. She started crying, but I made her leave.\n\nHer mom and she have been texting me, saying they can't find a new venue. I still said no.\n\nTwenty minutes ago, Sandra called me sobbing, saying that the wedding is off because of me.\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have let her use the venue at the usual price, or was what I did okay?\n\n\nEdit: Andres was not chill about this. He seemed exasperated. He was quite upset and basically just agreed to this, so she would drop it. I didn't include it because I did not see the relevance for the conflict between me and her\n\nUpdate: they are no longer together. Sandra just wrote me an email apologizing and, for some reason paypaled me 25,67€. Anyway. Thank you for weighing in",

I was getting my cricket bat out of the front closet when I stopped to think about consequences. I did not want to go to jail.\n\nInstead I took all their clothes and left quietly.

My stbx wife (28F) and I (29M) have wanted kids for years and we're thrilled when she finally got pregnant last year. From day one I wanted to be the most supportive husband and future father I could. Her father was never involved in her life. I used to work as a tech in labor and delivery, and my brother to put it kindly is not the most involved father. I saw too many problems up close when it came to lacking husband's, and I would be damned before I made the same mistakes\n\nThe problem is roughly 4 weeks into her pregnancy everything started going downhill\n\n- She stopped wanting sex. Fair enough. Hormones and stress make that a problem I went full stop. But then she didn't want any physical interaction. No cuddling, no kissing, slowly becoming more and more distant \n\n-Her eating constantly changed and she was terrible about it. She would demand I get her something all day then the moment I give it to her she wants something else, screaming at me. OK, again, hormonal issues I get it no problem \n\n- she never let me to go any appointments, no groups she went to, spent more time away\n\n-became cold and bitter. Constantly angry at me. This went on for months\n\n-slapped me a couple times when I forgot one of her dozens of tasks she assigned me during the day. Stopped doing anything for the house a month into the pregnancy. Sure, she's pregnant, I get it moving around is hard, but she wouldn't even do laundry about 4 weeks in and by 5 weeks I did everything. I'm also the primary source of income. I barely sleep. im running on fumes.\n\n-made me sleep in the guest room. Would always try and pick fights. I never once raised my voice, my hand, or my tone. I sat there and constantly mentally reminded myself this isn't her and this would all be worth it\n\n-she didn't want me to make any baby decisions. No name, no work on the nursery, nothing \n\nOne month before she delivered, she yelled how fucking useless I am and how I don't do anything and that she's staying with her mother. She didn't let me get her anything, come check on her, threatened to divorce me and get a restraining order if I even called her\n\nA couple weeks back, I found out about the birth of my son from a Facebook post. She posted it with her mother and some family. It fucking broke me. I tried to go to the hospital and visit. They had security kick me out.  \n\nAfter months of outright hatred, anger and abuse thrown at me 24/7, I fucking had it. Odds are im not even on the birth  certificate. I opened a new account and all my deposits go there. I took half out of our joint account. She never bought baby stuff ahead of time, who knows what that money was going towards, so now that she has to buy supplies for our son she's used up every cent\n\nI've gotten a lawyer. The house is mine, I'm the only one who spent money on it in any way. I've sent the rest of her stuff to her mother's house. I'm demanding a paternity test. Im not spending another damn cent until I get verification it's my son. Im absolutely divorcing her. She chose the stay at home life, if she cheated she's screwed. Her mother has money for a couple week stay, not even close to enough for full time support. If he is my son, I will absolutely be getting my rights as a father for a relationship. \n\nLast week, my stbx called. She was practically hyperventilating. She wanted to come home. She was crying how it was all a mistake. She's not staying with her mother. She's at a friend's house. She wants to come home. She wants our son to have his father. I told her I don't fucking believe he is my son. Why the fuck would she pull this shit if he is? Show me a paternity test, and I'll do everything I can for him, and him only. \n\nShe wants to meet tomorrow at a park so I can talk to her. I said sure, so I can finally say everything I should have said months ago to her face. My parents are hoping we can make up, but they absolutely understand if I won't. My brother is a deadbeat jackass so I don't care what he has to say, but my sister thinks I should at least hear her out",

Her boyfriend (the creep) is standing right there next to her.\n\nFor background, for the past two years she’s been a really religious, born-again Christian type. No boys, curfew, the whole nine yards. I’ve never had sex or had a boyfriend.\n\nSo in between sobs she tells me The Creep talked to her today, and told her that based on my symptoms (heavy bleeding and period cramps), and my “disrespectful behavior,” he’s sure that it’s from having sex. Not even an STD, but from having intercourse that was so intense it “injured my insides.” I’ve literally never heard of this and I looked it up later and it’s not even a fucking thing! Meanwhile The Creep is sitting there mostly silent, nodding along with what my mom is saying. I tried to get a word in but that’s when The Creep started on me, telling me “don’t even bother denying it, I’ve been a gynecologist for over a decade, I know this when I see it” yada yada yada. My mom then starts yelling at me like “how could you do this to me” and so on and so forth. She’s convinved I’ve been going out and having sex with boys from school when I’ve literally just been seeing the two or three friends I have.\n\nSo then they explain that they decided together some consequences for what I allegedly did—that I’m grounded, they’re going to switch out my iPhone for a dumb phone so I can’t use social media, I’m not allowed out to see my friends, and—THIS IS THE FUCKING CRAZY BIT—The Creep is going to perform a weekly “purity test” invasive vaginal exam to make sure that I’m not actively having sex until they can “trust” me again. And the first one is gonna be this weekend.\n\nI’m totally fucking lost here. Obviously I’m not going through with this, but I have no money AT ALL and nowhere I can stay even for one night. I’m leaning on making up some excuse to avoid the purity thing and keep my smartphone until I can sort something out. Any other ideas are appreciated!\n",

I guess this post breaks the rules on amitheasshole.\n\nMy mother-in-law wants to be in the room when I give birth. She is an unpleasant and pushy woman and none of her own daughters have allowed her near them when they gave birth. My sisters-in-law are all at least twelve years older than my husband and are all done having kids. I am the last chance for my mother-in-law to see the birth of a grandchild.\n\nI have zero interest in letting that judgemental old woman see me down there. She has objected to me from the beginning because I have tattoos and am not in any way interested in being a stay at home wife. I have a lot of tattoos and a career I plan on continuing. And I have tattoos down there that are none of her business.\n\nMy husband is her baby boy. He is a good husband and has stood up for me against her many times. When she tried to interfere with our wedding he put his foot down. When she tried to convince him that we should move to his hometown where he could work from but I would not be able to find an employer in my line of work he said no because my career is important to me and, while we can live off of his earnings and the cost of living is lower in his home town, our combined earnings are much better all together.\n\nShe has started crying to him that all she wants is to see a grandchild being born. All her friends have experienced it and she wants it. He is starting to crumble under her emotional blackmail.\n\nSo I made it clear that the only way I would agree was if, before the birth, my husband made arrangements for my father to witness him getting a colonoscopy. He would need a ride anyways so two birds one stone you know. He said I'm being ridiculous but I said none of my brothers would let my dad see them getting a camera shoved up their ass and he felt left out.\n\nHe finally understood my point but his mother is upset that I used such a stupid comparison. She says that it isn't the same thing at all. I offered to change it to me watching her get a Brazilian wax and she hasn't called in a week.\n\nI know seeing a baby being born might be her dream but I am not interested.\n\nAITA?",

My wife Jessica (32F) and I (30M) have been married for 2 years and are trying for a baby.\n\nJessica has an older sister, Mary, that she isn’t close to. She told me that they had a huge falling out over some family drama and just don’t speak anymore. I asked a few times about the entire situation but she would say she doesn’t like talking about it and doesn’t think it’s important. \n\nIt’s was Jessica’s brothers birthday yesterday and we were all over at his house to celebrate. Mary made an appearance and there was a lot of drama. Long story short, she called Jessica and her brothers out for still associating with their dad when they know that he is a child molester. No one was paying her any mind and I was really confused on what the hell was going on. When Mary left and Jessica and I went home, I asked Jessica what the hell happened. \n\nShe said that when they were kids, Mary used to claim that their dad used to molest her. I asked if it’s true and Jessica was stuttering a lot. She said she knows her dad used to do bad things but that Mary cut them all off when she turned 18 and moved out. I asked if she is admitting that she knows her dad was a child molester and did things to his own daughter. She said he doesn’t do it anymore and he was just in a really bad place in his life, and he apologised to Mary so there’s nothing else anyone can do for Mary. I was honestly appalled. I also feel so terrible for Mary. Jessica made it seem like Mary did something wrong and deserved to be basically exiled from the family. I could’ve never imagined that this is what happened. \n\nI asked if she expects me to now be willing to have that man around our future children and she started shouting at me, saying I’m judging him off something that happened 2 decades ago and whether I like it or not, he is going to be our child’s grandpa and he will be in their lives. I said if she insists on it, I think we need to hold off on having kids and have serious conversations about it. She’s extremely angry at me but I don’t know how I could better react to be honest.

We fell in love and got together on August 14, 2018. It had been his 34th birthday on August 1st and my 29th birthday was on August 24th but I was travelling so we said we will celebrate our big 30 and 35 together this year instead.\n\nThe year we spent together was the best year of my entire life. He was so loving, so caring, so compassionate, so so so wonderful. He brought joy to my life in ways I didn't know possible. I felt like the luckiest woman alive. It was like my whole life I had been waiting to meet the one, and when I met him the curtain was unveiled and I knew immediately I found him. He designed my engagement ring, and we were sorting out family matters before we get engaged. \n\nJuly 7 of this year we went out in the afternoon after work. He was never one for romantic cliches but he took me to see the sunset by the beach, a thing I loved and he made fun of. July 8 I didn't get to see him but I spoke to him before bed and he told me he would take me again that weekend \"unless something big happens\". He went out with his friend and I went to sleep. 2 hours later he was assaulted by a random drunk man. \n\nThe man kicked him in the head, causing a severe brain injury, and for 15 days he fought while in a coma. Even when he was pronounced brain dead, his body clung on, until finally on July 23 he could hold on no more. We met on a Tuesday, he was hit on a Tuesday, was pronounced brain dead on a Tuesday, and passed away on a Tuesday. He didn't make it to his 35th or my 30th. I then found out he had rented our first apartment and decorated it to my liking to surprise me with it on my birthday. We both had just opened a company. We both just got our PhD acceptances. Our life ended before it even began.\n\nOur family and friends supported me and continue to support me so I put on a brave face, but I honestly don't see the point of being here anymore. I would never take my own life, and I do believe this was his destiny, so I accepted that he is gone and I am here, but I am struggling so much. I feel guilty being here without him. I miss him so much and every single thing on this earth reminds me of him. I can't find a way out of my own head, no matter who I talk to or what I do. I talked about it loads, then stopped. I wrote my feelings loads, then stopped. Nothing seems to help for too long. \n\nNow I'm just here, waiting for my turn to follow him. I've even written my will. I can't see the future anymore. It's honestly the worst pain I've ever felt and it won't go away. I know they say time will heal but every second hurts. I'm exhausted.",

            "Please dont be ashamed No one in your situation should feel ashamed for not being in a good place emotionally If you were to watch a movie with a character living your life I dont know that you would judge them You would probably think Damn this is a dark movie This poor guy cant get a break\n\nEveryone here has a lot of really great advice for you about how to find help Please listen to them they know what theyre talking about I cant help with any of that but what I can do is show you that how youre feeling is valid\n\nWhen I was in therapy I had a lot going on all at once I felt like I was stupid for being as upset as I was but also couldnt stop spiraling To help me understand my position my therapist told me about pillars Its been a minute so I might be off base but I believe those pillars were Health Home Work Family Finance\n\nWhen one pillar is hit and broken you rely on the others to keep your roof up As each pillar is hit your roof becomes more unstable I dont know if you know but youve been hit in all your pillars Youre not eating so your body isnt well health youre facing homelessness home youve lost your job work youve lost a family you worked hard to grow family and because of your job situation you dont have reliable income finances\n\nThats every pillar Every damn one Its no wonder youre on the brink How can you keep the roof up when all your pillars have been hit How can you feel well when every thing that gives you security is under stress Where in your life can you turn that isnt tied to something deeply stressful\n\nHow youre feeling is understandable Anyone would feel the way you do in your situation I hope this post is a sign youre moving past the feeling of shame otherwise that shame will keep you from really accepting where youre at And you cant move forward without doing that\n\nAnd you deserve to move forward and feel better I really want to emphasize that I dont point out all of this to say everything is hopelessly broken Its not I point it out so you know you have every right to feel how you do You can move forward from this\n\nNow that you know the places that hurt you know the places that have to heal Knowing that youve been hit in the Finances and Work pillars means you know that just the small act of writing upediting a resume or filling out applications could help heal that pillar Knowing that Health has been hit means knowing that deciding to eat on a schedule even if only once a day to start can help heal that pillar Knowing that Family has been hit means knowing that reaching out to safe family members can help heal that pillar Small steps lead to big leaps and now you have a starting point\n\nI dont have much of a conclusion to this post but I just want to say You deserve so much kindness And happiness I hope you find those things in and for yourself",
            "Its very brave of you to even say that out loud Im so sorry I know the feeling And a guy I went to school with just took his life two days ago Im so so sorry that you are feeling like this I know the loss of someone you love hits so soooo heavily Life can take a turn for the worst sometimes and its unexpected and fucking horrible And youre going to feel like this for a while and its only when you look back that you can see how much healing youve gone through Please know that you arent alone"

        "input": "[L] [36,F] I’ve just been told I have 3-5 years to live I found out I have lung disease earlier this year and they did more tests last week. I have an aggressive kind that will essentially destroy the lungs and kill me. Most patients have 3-5 years. Half my lungs are already damaged so I don’t know what that does to the math. \n\nI have a sweet family, young kids (3 yo and 4 months old) and I’m devastated. I haven’t told anyone yet as I’m awaiting final word from one other doctor, which will be in any day now. I can feel the pressure of the impending call weighing on me, I’m just so sad. This is going to break my mom’s heart and hurt my partner so much. I can’t believe I don’t get to see my sweet kids grow up. \n\nIt just feels so surreal. It really doesn’t feel real sometimes and then it’ll knock the air out of me when I think about it. I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: you are all amazing! Thank you all so much. I can’t tell you helpful it is to just talk about it. Thank you all for being so kind and understanding.",
